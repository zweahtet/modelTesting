(d) A public water system in violation of the monitoring requirement of subsection (a) to test the same sample for E. coli following a total coliform-positive routine sample shall notify the State Board within 10 days after it learns of the violation and shall notify the public pursuant to Sections 64463, 64463.7, and 64465.
 
(e) A public water system in violation of the reporting requirement of subsection (c) to report monitoring results to the State Board or subsection (d) to notify the State Board shall notify the public pursuant to Sections 64463, 64463.7, and 64465.
 
§64424. Repeat Sampling.
(a) If a routine sample is total coliform-positive, a public water system shall collect a repeat sample set as described in paragraph (1) within 24 hours of being notified of the positive result.  The repeat samples shall all be collected within the same 24-hour time period.  A single service connection system may submit a request to the State Board to allow the collection of the repeat sample set over a three-day period. 
(1) A repeat sample set shall be at least three samples for each total coliform-positive sample. 
(2) If the system is unable to collect the samples within the 24-hour time period specified in subsection (a) or deliver the samples to the laboratory within 24 hours after collection because of circumstances beyond its control, the system shall notify the State Board within 24 hours.  The State Board will then determine how much time the system will have to collect the repeat samples.  
 
(b) Unless the condition for using alternative sampling locations or dual purpose sampling locations in Table 64424-A or B, respectively, is met, when collecting the repeat sample set, a public water system shall collect at least one repeat sample from the sampling tap where the original total coliform-positive sample was taken. Other repeat samples shall be collected within five service connections upstream or downstream of the original site. At least one sample shall be from upstream and one from downstream unless there is no upstream and/or downstream service connection. If a total coliform-positive sample is at the end of the distribution system, or one service connection away from the end of the distribution system, the system shall still take all required repeat samples.  The system may submit a request to the State Board to use an alternative sampling location in lieu of the requirement to collect at least one repeat sample upstream or downstream of the original sampling site.  Except as provided in Table 64424-B, a system required to conduct triggered source water monitoring under 40 CFR 141.402(a), which is incorporated by reference under Section 64430, shall take groundwater (not GWUDI) source sample(s) in addition to repeat samples required under this section.  If monitoring pursuant to Table 64424-B and in violation of the E. coli MCL, the system shall comply with the additional Ground Water Rule requirements in Table 64424-C.

Public water systems shall comply with the primary MCLs in table 64431-A as specified in this article.
 

Table 64431-A
Maximum Contaminant Levels
Inorganic Chemicals
 
   * MFL=million fibers per liter; MCL for fibers exceeding 10 µm in length.
 
§64432. Monitoring and Compliance--Inorganic Chemicals.
(a) All public water systems shall monitor to determine compliance with the nitrate and nitrite MCLs in table 64431-A, pursuant to subsections (d) through (f) and Section 64432.1.  All community and nontransient-noncommunity water systems shall monitor to determine compliance with the perchlorate MCL, pursuant to subsections (d), (e), and (l), and section 64432.3.  All community and nontransient-noncommunity water systems shall also monitor to determine compliance with the other MCLs in table 64431-A, pursuant to subsections (b) through (n) and, for asbestos, section 64432.2. Monitoring shall be conducted in the year designated by the State Board of each compliance period beginning with the compliance period starting January 1, 1993.
 
(b) Unless directed otherwise by the State Board, each community and nontransient-noncommunity water system shall initiate monitoring for an inorganic chemical within six months following the effective date of the regulation establishing the MCL for the chemical and the addition of the chemical to table 64431-A.  If otherwise performed in accordance with this section, groundwater monitoring for an inorganic chemical performed no more than two years prior to the effective date of the regulation establishing the MCL may be used to satisfy the requirement for initiating monitoring within six months following such effective date.
 
(c) Unless more frequent monitoring is required pursuant to this Chapter, the frequency of monitoring for the inorganic chemicals listed in table 64431-A, except for asbestos, nitrate/nitrite, and perchlorate, shall be as follows:  
(1) Each compliance period, all community and nontransient-noncommunity systems using groundwater shall monitor once during the year designated by the State Board.  The State Board will designate the year based on historical monitoring frequency and laboratory capacity. All community and nontransient-noncommunity systems using approved surface water shall monitor annually.  All systems monitoring at distribution entry points which have combined surface and groundwater sources shall monitor annually. 
(2) Quarterly samples shall be collected and analyzed for any chemical if analyses of such samples indicate a continuous or persistent trend toward higher levels of that chemical, based on an evaluation of previous data.  
 
(d) For the purposes of sections 64432, 64432.1, 64432.2, and 64432.3, detection shall be defined by the detection limits for purposes of reporting (DLRs) in table 64432-A.
 

Table 64432-A
Detection Limits for Purposes of Reporting (DLRs) for Regulated Inorganic Chemicals  
 
 
 * MFL=million fibers per liter; DLR for fibers exceeding 10 um in length.
 
(e) Samples shall be collected from each water source or a supplier may collect a minimum of one sample at every entry point to the distribution system which is representative of each source after treatment. The system shall collect each sample at the same sampling site, unless a change is approved by the State Board.
 
(f) A water system may request approval from the State Board to composite samples from up to five sampling sites, provided that the number of sites to be composited is less than the ratio of the MCL to the DLR. Approval will be based on a review of three years of historical data, well construction and aquifer information for groundwater, and intake location, similarity of sources, and watershed characteristics for surface water. Compositing shall be done in the laboratory.
(1) Systems serving more than 3,300 persons shall composite only from sampling sites within a single system. Systems serving 3,300 persons or less may composite among different systems up to the 5-sample limit.
(2) If any inorganic chemical is detected in the composite sample at a level equal to or greater than one fifth of the MCL, a follow-up sample shall be analyzed within 14 days from each sampling site included in the composite for the contaminants which exceeded the one-fifth-MCL level. If available, duplicates of the original sample taken from each sampling site used in the composite may be used instead of resampling; the analytical results shall be reported within 14 days. The water supplier may collect up to two additional samples each from one or more of the sources to confirm the result(s). 
(3) Compliance for each site shall be determined on the basis of the individual follow-up samples, or on the average of the follow-up and confirmation sample(s) if the supplier collects confirmation sample(s) for each detection.
 
(g) If the level of any inorganic chemical, except for nitrate, nitrite, nitrate plus nitrite, or perchlorate, exceeds the MCL, the water supplier shall do one of the following:
(1) Inform the State Board within 48 hours and monitor quarterly beginning in the next quarter after the exceedance occurred; or 
(2) Inform the State Board within seven days from the receipt of the analysis and, as confirmation, collect one additional sample within 14 days from receipt of the analysis.  If the average of the two samples collected exceeds the MCL, this information shall be reported to the State Board within 48 hours and the water supplier shall monitor quarterly beginning in the next quarter after the exceedance occurred. 
 
(h) If the concentration of an inorganic chemical exceeds ten times the MCL, within 48 hours of receipt of the result the water supplier shall notify the State Board and resample as confirmation.  The water supplier shall notify the State Board of the result(s) of the confirmation sample(s) within 24 hours of receipt of the confirmation result(s).
(1) If the average concentration of the original and confirmation sample(s) is less than or equal to ten times the MCL, the water supplier shall monitor quarterly beginning in the quarter following the quarter in which the exceedance occurred.
(2) If the average concentration of the original and confirmation sample(s) exceeds ten times the MCL, the water supplier shall, if directed by the State Board;
(A) Immediately discontinue use of the contaminated water source; and
(B) Not return the source to service without written approval from the State Board.
 
(i) Compliance with the MCLs shall be determined by a running annual average; if any one sample would cause the annual average to exceed the MCL, the system is immediately in violation.  If a system takes more than one sample in a quarter, the average of all the results for that quarter shall be used when calculating the running annual average.  If a system fails to complete four consecutive quarters of monitoring, the running annual average shall be based on an average of the available data. 
 
(j) If a system using groundwater has collected a minimum of two quarterly samples or a system using approved surface water has collected a minimum of four quarterly samples and the sample results have been below the MCL, the system may apply to the State Board for a reduction in monitoring frequency.
 
(k) Water quality data collected prior to January 1, 1990, and/or data collected in a manner inconsistent with this section shall not be used in the determination of compliance with the monitoring requirements for inorganic chemicals. 
 
(l) Water quality data collected in compliance with the monitoring requirements of this section by a wholesaler providing water to a public water system shall be acceptable for use by that system for compliance with the monitoring requirements of this section.  
 
(m) A water system may apply to the State Board for a waiver from the monitoring frequencies specified in subsection (c)(1), if the system has conducted at least three rounds of monitoring (three periods for groundwater sources or three years for approved surface water sources) and all previous analytical results are less than the MCL. The water system shall specify the basis for its request. If granted a waiver, a system shall collect a minimum of one sample per source while the waiver is in effect and the term of the waiver shall not exceed one compliance cycle (i.e., nine years). 
 
(n) A water system may be eligible for a waiver from the monitoring frequencies for cyanide specified in subsection (c)(1) without any prior monitoring if it is able to document that it is not vulnerable to cyanide contamination pursuant to the requirements in §64445(d)(1) or (d)(2).  
 
(o) Transient-noncommunity water systems shall monitor for the inorganic chemicals in table 64431-A as follows:  
(1) All sources shall be monitored at least once for fluoride; and 
(2) Surface water sources for parks and other facilities with an average daily population use of more than 1,000 people and/or which are determined to be subject to potential contamination based on a sanitary survey shall be monitored at the same frequency as community water systems.
 
§64432.1. Monitoring and Compliance--Nitrate and Nitrite.
(a) To determine compliance with the MCL for nitrate in Table 64431-A, all public water systems using groundwater and transient-noncommunity systems using approved surface water shall monitor annually, and all community and nontransient-noncommunity systems using approved surface water shall monitor quarterly. 
(1) The water supplier shall require the laboratory to notify the supplier within 24 hours whenever the level of nitrate in a single sample exceeds the MCL, and shall ensure that a contact person is available to receive such analytical results 24-hours a day. The water supplier shall also require the laboratory to immediately notify the State Board of any acute nitrate MCL exceedance if the laboratory cannot make direct contact with the designated contact person within 24 hours. Within 24 hours of notification, the water supplier shall:
(A) Collect another sample, and 
(B) Analyze the new sample; if the average of the two nitrate sample results exceeds the MCL, report the result to the State Board within 24 hours. If the average does not exceed the MCL, inform the State Board of the results within seven days from the receipt of the original analysis.  
(C) If a system is unable to resample within 24 hours, it shall notify the consumers by issuing a Tier 1 Public Notice pursuant to section 64463.1 and shall collect and analyze a confirmation sample within two weeks of notification of the results of the first sample.
(2) For public water systems using groundwater, the repeat monitoring frequency shall be quarterly for at least one year following any one sample in which the concentration is greater than or equal to 50 percent of the MCL.  After four consecutive quarterly samples are less than the MCL, a system may request that the State Board reduce monitoring frequency to annual sampling.  
(3) For public water systems using approved surface water, the repeat monitoring frequency shall be quarterly following any one sample in which the concentration is greater than or equal to 50 percent of the MCL. After four consecutive quarterly samples are less than 50 percent of the MCL, a system may request that the State Board reduce monitoring frequency to annual sampling. A system using approved surface water shall return to quarterly monitoring if any one sample is greater than or equal to 50 percent of the MCL.  
(4) After any round of quarterly sampling is completed, each community and nontransient-noncommunity system which initiates annual monitoring shall take subsequent samples during the quarter which previously resulted in the highest analytical results.  
 
(b) All public water systems shall monitor to determine compliance with the MCL for nitrite in Table 64431-A, by taking one sample at each sampling site during the compliance period beginning January 1, 1993.  
(1) If the level of nitrite in a single sample is greater than the MCL, the water supplier shall proceed as for nitrate in accordance with paragraph (a)(1) of this section.
(2) The repeat monitoring frequency for systems with an analytical result for nitrite that is greater than or equal to 50 percent of the MCL shall be quarterly monitoring for at least one year. After four consecutive quarterly samples are less than the MCL, a system may request that the State Board reduce monitoring frequency to annual sampling, collecting subsequent samples during the quarter which previously resulted in the highest analytical results.  
(3) The repeat monitoring frequency for systems with an analytical result for nitrite that is less than 50 percent of the MCL shall be one sample during each compliance period (every three years).  
 
(c) All public water systems shall determine compliance with the MCL for nitrate plus nitrite in Table 64431-A. If the level exceeds the MCL, the water supplier shall proceed as for nitrate in accordance with paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(4) of this section.
 
§64432.2. Monitoring and Compliance - Asbestos.
(a) All community and nontransient-noncommunity water systems are required to monitor to determine compliance with the MCL for asbestos in Table 64431-A during the year designated by the State Board of the first compliance period of each nine-year compliance cycle, beginning in the compliance period starting January 1, 1993. The State Board will designate the year based on historical monitoring frequency and laboratory capacity. 
(1) If a groundwater system is vulnerable to asbestos contamination solely in its source water, it shall collect one sample at every entry point to the distribution system which is representative of each water source after treatment and proceed in accordance with Subsections 64432(c)(2) through (e) and Subsections 64432(g) through (l).  
(2) All approved surface water systems shall be designated vulnerable to asbestos contamination in their source waters. If a surface water system is vulnerable solely in its source water, it shall proceed as in paragraph (1) above. 
(3) If a system is vulnerable to asbestos contamination due to leaching of asbestos-cement pipe, with or without vulnerability to asbestos contamination in its source water, it shall take one sample at a tap served by asbestos-cement pipe under conditions where asbestos contamination is most likely to occur.
 
(b) If the level of asbestos exceeds the MCL in Table 64431-A, the supplier shall report to the State Board within 48 hours and monitor quarterly beginning in the next quarter after the violation occurred. A system may request that the State Board reduce monitoring frequency to one sample every compliance cycle, pursuant to §64432(j).  
 
(c) If a system is not vulnerable either to asbestos contamination in its source water or due to leaching of asbestos-cement pipe, it may apply to the State Board for a waiver of the monitoring requirements in paragraphs (a)(1) through (3) of this section. The State Board will determine the vulnerability of groundwater sources on the basis of historical monitoring data and possible influence of serpentine formations. Vulnerability due to leaching of asbestos-cement pipe will be determined by the State Board on the basis of the presence of such pipe in the distribution system and evaluation of the corrosivity of the water. The period of the waiver shall be three years.
 
§64432.3. Monitoring and Compliance - Perchlorate.
(a) For initial monitoring for the perchlorate MCL, each community and nontransient-noncommunity water system shall collect two samples at each source in a year, five to seven months apart.  At least one of the samples shall be collected during the period from May 1 through September 30 (vulnerable time), unless the State Board specifies a different vulnerable time for the water system due to seasonal conditions related to use, manufacture and/or weather.  
 
(b) Data collected since January 3, 2001, that is in conformance with subsection (a) may be used to comply with the initial monitoring requirement.
 
(c) After meeting the initial monitoring requirements in subsection (a) and if no perchlorate is detected, during each compliance period each water system:
(1) Using groundwater, shall monitor once during the year designated by the State Board; 
(2) Using approved surface water, shall monitor annually; and
(3) Monitoring at distribution entry points that have combined surface and groundwater sources, shall monitor annually; if perchlorate is detected in the water from the combined sources, the water system shall sample each source individually to determine which is contaminated.
 
(d) The water supplier shall require the laboratory to notify the supplier within 48 hours of the result whenever the level of perchlorate in a single sample exceeds the MCL, and shall ensure that a contact person is available to receive such analytical results 24-hours a day.  The water supplier shall also require the laboratory to immediately notify the State Board of any perchlorate MCL exceedance if the laboratory cannot make direct contact with the designated contact person within 48 hours.  Within 48 hours of notification of the result, the water supplier shall:
(1) Collect and analyze a confirmation sample, and 
(2) If the average of the two perchlorate sample results exceeds the MCL, report the result to the State Board within 48 hours.  If the average does not exceed the MCL, inform the State Board of the results within seven days from the receipt of the original analytical result.
(3) If a system is unable to resample within 48 hours, it shall issue a Tier 1 notice to the consumers in accordance with sections 64463 and 64463.1 and shall collect and analyze a confirmation sample within two weeks of notification of the results of the first sample.
 
(e) A water system shall monitor quarterly any source in which perchlorate has been detected.  After four consecutive quarterly samples indicate that perchlorate is not present at or above the DLR, a system may request that the State Board reduce monitoring to the frequencies specified in paragraphs (c)(1) through (3).  
 
(f) A water system serving less than 10,000 persons may apply to the State Board for a variance from the perchlorate MCL if it can demonstrate that the estimated annualized cost per household for treatment to comply with the MCL exceeds 1% of the median household income in the community within which the customers served by the water system reside.
 
§64432.8. Sampling of Treated Water Sources.
(a) Each water supplier utilizing treatment to comply with one or more MCL(s) in Table 64431-A shall collect monthly samples of the treated water at a site prior to the distribution system and analyze for the chemical(s) for which treatment is being applied.  If the treated water exceeds an MCL, other than a nitrate, nitrite, nitrate plus nitrite, or perchlorate MCL, within 48 hours of receipt of the result the water supplier shall resample the treated water to confirm the result and report the initial result to the State Board.  The result of the analysis of the confirmation sample shall be reported to the State Board within 24 hours of receipt of the confirmation result.  For nitrate, nitrite, nitrate plus nitrite, or perchlorate treated water monitoring, the water supplier shall comply with the requirements of section 64432.1(a)(1) for nitrate, section 64432.1(b)(1) for nitrite, section 64432.1(c) for nitrate plus nitrite, and section 64432.3(d) for perchlorate.
 
(b) The State Board may require more frequent monitoring based on an evaluation of the treatment process used, the treatment effectiveness and efficiency, and the concentration of the inorganic chemical in the water source.

Table 64442
Radionuclide Maximum Contaminant Levels (MCLs) 
and Detection Levels for Purposes of Reporting (DLRs)
 
 
(b) Each system shall monitor to determine compliance with the MCLs in table 64442, as follows: 
(1) Monitor at each water source, or every entry point to the distribution system that is representative of all sources being used under normal operating conditions; conduct all monitoring at the same sample site(s) unless a change is approved by the State Board, based on a review of the system and its historical water quality data;
(2) For quarterly monitoring, monitor during the same month (first, second or third) of each quarter during each quarter monitored;
(3) By December 31, 2007, complete initial monitoring that consists of four consecutive quarterly samples at each sampling site for each radionuclide in table 64442, except that nontransient-noncommunity water systems shall not be required to monitor radium-228 as a separate analyte, but shall monitor for compliance with the combined radium MCL using the analytical method described in Prescribed Procedures for Measurement of Radioactivity in Drinking Water, Section 6, Alpha-emitting Radium Isotopes in Drinking Water, Method 903.0 (EPA/600/4-80-032, August 1980):
(A) Data collected for a sampling site between January 1, 2001, and December 31, 2004, may be used to satisfy the initial monitoring requirement, subject to the State Board’s approval based on whether the analytical methods, DLRs, sampling sites, and the frequency of monitoring used were consistent with this article.
(B) For gross alpha particle activity, uranium, radium-226 and radium-228, the State Board may waive the final two quarters of initial monitoring at a sampling site if the results from the previous two quarters are below the DLR(s) and the sources are not known to be vulnerable to contamination. 
 
(c) Any new system or new source for an existing system shall begin monitoring pursuant to Subsection (b) within the first quarter after initiating water service to the public.  
 
(d) After initial monitoring, each system shall monitor for each radionuclide at each sampling site at a frequency determined by the monitoring result(s) [single sample result or average of sample results if more than one sample collected] from the most recent compliance period as follows:
(1) For nontransient-noncommunity water systems, the results for the total radium analyses shall be averaged.
(2) For community water systems, the results of radium-226 and radium-228 analyses shall be added and the average calculated.    
(3) The values used for the radionuclide MCLs and DLRs shall be as specified in Table 64442.
(4) If the single sample result or average is:
A. Below the DLR, the system shall collect and analyze at least one sample every nine years (3 compliance periods).
B. At or above the DLR, but at or below ½ the MCL, the system shall collect and analyze at least one sample every six years.
C. Above ½ the MCL, but not above the MCL, the system shall collect and analyze at least one sample every three years.
 
(e) A system that monitors quarterly may composite up to four consecutive samples from a single sampling site if analysis is done within a year of the first sample’s collection.  If the result of the composited sample is greater than ½ the MCL, at least one additional quarterly sample shall be analyzed to evaluate the range and trend of results over time before allowing the system to reduce the monitoring frequency.
 
(f) A gross alpha particle activity measurement may be substituted for other measurements by adding the 95% confidence interval (1.65σ, where σ is the standard deviation of the net counting rate of the sample) to it; and if,
(1) For uranium and radium measurements (after initial radium-228 monitoring has been completed), the gross alpha measurement does not exceed 5 pCi/L; or
(2) For radium measurements (after initial radium-228 monitoring has been completed), the result obtained from subtracting the uranium measurement from the gross alpha measurement does not exceed 5 pCi/L.
 
(g) If any sample result is greater than an MCL:
(1) For a system monitoring less than quarterly, quarterly samples shall be collected and analyzed to determine compliance, pursuant to subsection (h);
(2) For a system that already has four consecutive quarterly results, compliance shall be determined pursuant to subsection (h).
(3) The system shall monitor quarterly until the results of four consecutive quarterly sample results do not exceed the MCL.
 
(h) A system with one or more sample results greater than an MCL shall determine compliance with the MCL as follows:
(1) At each sampling site, based on the analytical results for that site.  Any confirmation sample result shall be averaged with the initial result.
(2) Using all monitoring results collected under this section during the previous 12 months, even if more than the minimum required number of samples was collected.
(3) By a running annual average of four consecutive quarters of sampling results.  Averages shall be rounded to the same number of significant figures as the MCL for which compliance is being determined.  
(A) If any sample result will cause the annual average at any sample site to exceed the MCL, the system shall be out of compliance immediately upon receiving the result; 
(B) If a system has not analyzed the required number of samples, compliance shall be determined by the average of the samples collected at the site during the most recent 12 months; and
(C) If a sample result is less than the DLR in table 64442, zero shall be used to calculate the annual average, unless a gross alpha particle activity is being used in lieu of radium-226, total radium, and/or uranium.  In that case, if the gross alpha particle activity result is less than the DLR, ½ the DLR shall be used to calculate the annual average. 
(4) If compositing is allowed at a sampling site, by the results of a composite of four consecutive quarterly samples.
(5) If the system can provide documentation that a sample was subject to sampling or analytical errors, the State Board may invalidate the result based on its review of the documentation, the sampling result, and the historical sampling data.
(6) Each system shall ensure that the laboratory analyzing its samples collected for compliance with this article calculates and reports the sample-specific Minimum Detectable Activity at the 95% confidence level (MDA95) along with the sample results.   The MDA95 shall not exceed the DLR and shall be calculated as described in ANSI N42.23 Measurement and Associated Instrumentation Quality Assurance for Radiobioassay Laboratories, Appendix A.7.6 (September 10, 1995).
 
§64443. MCLs and Monitoring - Beta Particle and Photon Radioactivity
(a) Each community and nontransient-noncommunity water system (system) shall comply with the primary MCLs in table 64443 and use the DLRs for reporting monitoring results:
 
Table 64443
Radionuclide Maximum Contaminant Levels (MCLs) 
and Detection Levels for Purposes of Reporting (DLRs)
 
 
(b) Each system designated by the State Board as vulnerable to contamination by nuclear facilities and/or a determination of vulnerability by a source water assessment, as defined in section 64401.57, shall monitor to determine compliance with the MCLs in Table 64443, as follows:
(1) Beginning within one quarter after being notified by the State Board that the system is vulnerable, quarterly for beta/photon emitters and annually for tritium and strontium-90 at each water source, or every entry point to the distribution system that is representative of all sources being used under normal operating conditions, and shall conduct all monitoring at the same sample site(s) unless a change is approved by the State Board, based on a review of the system and its historical water quality data;
(2) For quarterly monitoring, during the same month (first, second or third) of each quarter during each quarter monitored; and
(3) If the gross beta particle activity minus the naturally-occurring potassium-40 beta particle activity at a sampling site has a running annual average less than or equal to 50 pCi/L (screening level), reduce monitoring to a single sample for beta/photon emitters, tritium and strontium-90 once every three years (compliance monitoring period).
 
(c) Each system designated by the State Board as utilizing waters contaminated by effluents from nuclear facilities on the basis of analytical data and/or a Source Water Assessment, shall:
(1) Beginning within one quarter after being notified by the State Board of the above designation, monitor on an ongoing basis pursuant to subparagraphs (A) through (C) at each sampling site:
(A) For beta/photon emitters, quarterly by analyzing three monthly samples and averaging the results or by analyzing a composite of three monthly samples;

(C) For strontium-90 and tritium, annually by analyzing four quarterly samples and averaging the results or by analyzing a composite of four quarterly samples.    
(2) If the gross beta particle activity minus the naturally-occurring potassium-40 beta particle activity at a sampling site has a running annual average (computed quarterly) less than or equal to 15 pCi/L (screening level), reduce the frequency of monitoring to a single sample for beta/photon emitters, iodine-131, strontium-90 and tritium once every three years (compliance monitoring period).  
 
(d) If the gross beta particle activity minus the naturally-occurring potassium-40 beta particle activity exceeds a system’s screening level pursuant to Subsection (b)(3) or (c)(2):  
(1) The sample shall be analyzed to identify the primary radionuclides present and the doses shall be calculated and summed to determine compliance with the MCL for beta particle/photon radioactivity; and  
(2) Except for strontium-90 and tritium for which the MCLs provide the average annual concentrations assumed to produce a total body or organ dose equivalent to 4 millirem/year, the concentration of manmade radionuclides shall be calculated using the 168 hour data list in “Maximum Permissible Body Burdens and Maximum Permissible Concentrations of Radionuclides in Air and in Water for Occupational Exposure,” NBS (National Bureau of Standards) Handbook 69 as amended August 1963, U.S. Department of Commerce.  (See Title 40, Code of Federal Regulations, section 141.66(d)(2).)
 
(e) If a system analyzes for naturally-occurring potassium-40 beta particle activity from the same or equivalent samples used for the gross beta particle activity analysis,   the potassium-40 beta particle activity shall be calculated by multiplying elemental potassium concentrations (in mg/L) by a factor of 0.82 pCi/mg.
 
(f) A system required to monitor under this section may use environmental surveillance data (collected by the nuclear facility to detect any radionuclide contamination) in lieu of monitoring, subject to the State Board’s determination that the data is applicable to the system based on a review of the data and the hydrogeology of the area.  In the event that there is a release of radioactivity or radioactive contaminants from the nuclear facility, a system using environmental surveillance data shall begin the monitoring in paragraph (b)(1) or (c)(1)(A) through (C), whichever is most applicable.
 
(g) If a sample result is greater than an MCL:
(1) Compliance shall be determined as follows:
(A) At each sampling site, based on the analytical results for that site.  Any confirmation sample result shall be averaged with the initial result.
(B) Using all monitoring results collected under this article during the previous 12 months, even if more than the minimum required number of samples was collected.
(C) By a running annual average of four consecutive quarters of sampling results where quarterly monitoring is required, or by an annual sample when applicable for tritium and strontium-90.  Averages shall be rounded to the same number of significant figures as the MCL for which compliance is being determined.  
1. If any sample result will cause the annual average at any sample site to exceed the MCL, the system shall be out of compliance immediately after being notified of the result; 
2. If a system has not analyzed the required number of samples, compliance shall be determined by the average of the samples collected at the site during the most recent 12 months; and
3. If a sample result is less than the DLR in 64443, zero shall be used to calculate the annual average. 
(D) If the system can provide documentation that a sample was subject to sampling or analytical errors, the State Board may invalidate the result based on its review of the documentation, the sampling result, and the historical sampling data.
(E) Each system shall ensure that the laboratory analyzing its samples collected for compliance with this article calculates and reports the sample-specific Minimum Detectable Activity at the 95% confidence level (MDA95) along with the sample results.   The MDA95 shall not exceed the DLR and is calculated as described in ANSI N42.23 Measurement and Associated Instrumentation Quality Assurance for Radiobioassay Laboratories, Appendix A.7.6 (September 10, 1995). (See Title 40, Code of Federal Regulations, section 141.66(d)(2).)
(2) If a sample has a gross beta/photon radioactivity level greater than the MCL: 
(A) A system shall monitor monthly beginning the month after receiving a result greater than the MCL and continue monthly monitoring until an average of three consecutive monthly sample results does not exceed the MCL ;
(B) The system shall then monitor quarterly until the average of four consecutive quarterly sample results does not exceed the MCL; and

Article 5.5. Primary Standards ‑‑ Organic Chemicals
§64444. Maximum Contaminant Levels – Organic Chemicals.
The MCLs for the primary drinking water chemicals shown in table 64444‑A shall not be exceeded in the water supplied to the public.
 
Table 64444‑A
Maximum Contaminant Levels
Organic Chemicals
 
 
 
Table 64444‑A (continued)
Maximum Contaminant Levels
Organic Chemicals
 
*MCL is for either a single isomer or the sum of the isomers.
 
§64445. Initial Sampling ‑ Organic Chemicals.
(a) Each community and nontransient‑noncommunity water system shall collect four quarterly samples during the year designated by the State Board of each compliance period beginning with the compliance period starting January 1, 1993, from each water source at a site prior to any treatment and test for all applicable organic chemicals listed in table 64444‑A. The State Board will designate the year based on historical monitoring frequency and laboratory capacity.  For surface sources, the samples shall be taken at each water intake. For groundwater sources, the samples shall be taken at each well head. Where multiple intakes or wells draw from the same water supply, the State Board will consider sampling of representative sources as a means of complying with this section. Selection of representative sources shall be based on evidence which includes a hydrogeological survey and sampling results. Wells shall be allowed to flow for a minimum of 15 minutes before sampling to insure that the samples reflect the water quality of the source. In place of water source samples, a supplier may collect samples at sites located at the entry points to the distribution system. The samples shall be representative of each source after treatment. The system shall collect each sample at the same sampling site, unless a change is approved by the State Board.
 
(b) For any organic chemical added to table 64444‑A, the water system shall initiate the quarterly monitoring for that chemical in January of the calendar year after the effective date of the MCL. 
 
(c) A water system may request approval from the State Board to composite samples from up to five sampling sites, provided that the number of the sites to be composited is less than the ratio of the MCL to the DLR in §64445.1. Approval will be based on a review of three years of historical data, well construction and aquifer information for groundwater, and intake location, similarity of sources, and watershed characteristics for surface water. Compositing shall be done in the laboratory and analyses shall be conducted within 14 days of sample collection.
(1) Systems serving more than 3,300 persons shall composite only from sampling sites within a single system. Systems serving 3,300 persons or less may composite among different systems up to the 5‑sample limit.
(2) If any organic chemical is detected in the composite sample, a follow‑up sample shall be analyzed within 14 days from each sampling site included in the composite for the contaminants which were detected. The water supplier shall report the results to the State Board within 14 days of the follow‑up sample collection. If available, duplicates of the original sample taken from each sampling site used in the composite may be used instead of resampling.
 
(d) A water system may apply to the State Board for a monitoring waiver for one or more of the organic chemicals on table 64444‑A in accordance with the following:
(1) A source may be eligible for a waiver if it can be documented that the chemical has not been previously used, manufactured, transported, stored, or disposed of within the watershed or zone of influence and therefore, that the source can be designated nonvulnerable.
(2) If previous use of the chemical locally is unknown or the chemical is known to have been used previously and the source cannot be designated nonvulnerable pursuant to Paragraph (d)(1), it may still be eligible for a waiver based on a review related to susceptibility to contamination.  The application to the State Board for a waiver based on susceptibility shall include the following:
(A) previous monitoring results;
(B) user population characteristics;
(C) proximity to sources of contamination;
(D) surrounding land uses;
(E) degree of protection of the water source;
(F) environmental persistence and transport of the chemical in water, soil and air;
(G) elevated nitrate levels at the water supply source; and
(H) historical system operation and maintenance data including previous State Board inspection results.
(3) To apply for a monitoring waiver for VOCs, the water system shall have completed the initial four quarters of monitoring pursuant to subsection (a) or three consecutive years of monitoring with no VOCs detected.  If granted a waiver for VOC monitoring, a system using groundwater shall collect a minimum of one sample from every sampling site every six years and a system using surface water shall not be required to monitor for the term of the waiver.  The term of a VOC waiver shall not exceed three years.
(4) To obtain a monitoring waiver for one or more of the SOCs, the water system may apply before doing the initial round of monitoring or shall have completed three consecutive years of annual monitoring with no detection of the SOC(s) listed.  If the system is granted a waiver for monitoring for one or more SOC(s), no monitoring for the waived SOC(s) shall be required for the term of the waiver, which shall not exceed three years.
 
(e) For water sources designated by a water supplier as standby sources, the water supplier shall sample each source for any organic chemical added to table 64444‑A once within the three-year period beginning in January of the calendar year after the effective date of the MCL.
 
(f) Water quality data collected prior to January 1, 1988, for VOCs, or January 1, 1990, for SOCs, and/or data collected in a manner inconsistent with this section shall not be used in the determination of compliance with the monitoring requirements for organic chemicals.
 
(g) MTBE data (i.e., a single sample) collected in a manner consistent with this section after January 1, 1998 in which no MTBE is detected, along with a designation of nonvulnerability pursuant to subsection (d), may be used to satisfy the initial monitoring requirements in subsection (a).  If the requirements are satisfied in this way by a water system, the system shall begin annual monitoring pursuant to section 64445.1(b)(1).
 
(h) Water quality data collected in compliance with the monitoring requirements of this section by a wholesaler agency providing water to a public water system shall be acceptable for use by that system for compliance with the monitoring requirements of this section.
 
(i) Results obtained from groundwater monitoring performed for an organic chemical in accordance with this section and not more than two calendar years prior to the effective date of a regulation establishing the MCL for that organic chemical may be substituted to partially satisfy the initial monitoring requirements required by this section for that organic chemical.  Requests to substitute groundwater monitoring results shall be made in accordance with the following:
 
1. Requests shall be made in writing by the water system to the State Board; and
 
2. If the State Board approves the request then results from a given calendar quarter will only be eligible to substitute for a single required initial monitoring result during that same quarter of initial monitoring. (e.g. the second quarter of 2016 may be substituted for the second quarter of 2018). 
 
3. No more than three of the four quarterly samples as required by section 64445(a) or (b) may be substituted. 
 
§64445.1. Repeat Monitoring and Compliance – Organic Chemicals.
(a) For the purposes of this article, detection shall be defined by the detection limits for purposes of reporting (DLRs) in table 64445.1‑A:
 
Table 64445.1‑A
Detection Limits for Purposes of Reporting (DLRs)
for Regulated Organic Chemicals
 
 

 
(b) When organic chemicals are not detected pursuant to table 64445.1‑A.
(1) A water system which has not detected any of the VOCs on table 64444‑A during the initial four quarters of monitoring, shall collect and analyze one sample annually. After a minimum of three years of annual sampling with no detection of a VOC in table 64444‑A, a system using groundwater may reduce the monitoring frequency to one sample during each compliance period.  A system using surface water shall continue monitoring annually.
(2) A system serving more than 3,300 persons which has not detected an SOC on table 64444‑A during the initial four quarters of monitoring shall collect a minimum of two quarterly samples for that SOC in one year during the year designated by the State Board of each subsequent compliance period.  The year will be designated on the basis of historical monitoring frequency and laboratory capacity.
(3) A system serving 3,300 persons or less which has not detected an SOC on table 64444‑A during the initial four quarters of monitoring shall collect a minimum of one sample for that SOC during the year designated by the State Board of each subsequent compliance period.  The year will be designated on the basis of historical monitoring frequency and laboratory capacity.
 
(c) When organic chemicals are detected pursuant to table 64445.1‑A.
(1) Prior to proceeding with the requirements of paragraphs (2) through (7), the water supplier may first confirm the analytical result, as follows: Within seven days from the notification of an initial finding from a laboratory reporting the presence of one or more organic chemicals in a water sample, the water supplier shall collect one or two additional sample(s) to confirm the initial finding.  Confirmation of the initial finding shall be shown by the presence of the organic chemical in either the first or second additional sample, and the detected level of the contaminant for compliance purposes shall be the average of the initial and confirmation sample(s).  The initial finding shall be disregarded if two additional samples do not show the presence of the organic chemical.
(2) If one or both of the related organic chemicals heptachlor and heptachlor epoxide are detected, subsequent monitoring shall analyze for both chemicals until there has been no detection of either chemical for one compliance period.
(3) A groundwater sampling site at which one or more of the following chemicals has been detected shall be monitored quarterly for vinyl chloride:  trichloroethylene, tetrachloroethylene, 1,2-dichloroethane, 1,1,1-trichloroethane, cis-1,2-dichloroethylene, trans-1,2-dichloroethylene, or 1,1-dichloroethylene.  If vinyl chloride is not detected in the first quarterly sample, the sampling site shall be monitored once for vinyl chloride during each compliance period.
(4) If the detected level of organic chemicals for any sampling site does not exceed any shown in table 64444‑A, the water source shall be resampled every three months and the samples analyzed for the detected chemicals.  After one year of sampling an approved surface water system or two quarters of sampling a groundwater system, the State Board will consider allowing the water supplier to reduce the sampling to once per year upon request, based on a review of previous sampling data.  Systems shall monitor during the quarter(s) which previously yielded the highest analytical results.
(5) If the detected level of an organic chemical for any sampling site exceeds that listed in table 64444‑A, the water supplier shall report this information to the State Board within 48 hours of receipt of the result.  Unless use of the contaminated source is discontinued, the water supplier shall resample the contaminated source and compliance shall be determined as follows:
(A) Water systems serving more than 3,300 persons shall sample monthly for six months and shall submit the results to the State Board as specified in section 64469.  If the average concentration of the initial finding, confirmation sample(s), and six subsequent monthly samples does not exceed the MCL shown in table 64444‑A the water supplier may reduce the sampling frequency to once every three months.  If the running annual average or the average concentration of the initial finding, confirmation sample(s), and six subsequent monthly samples exceeds the MCL shown in table 64444-A, the water system shall be deemed to be in violation of section 64444. 
(B) Water systems serving 3,300 persons or less shall sample quarterly for a minimum of one year and shall submit the results to the State Board as specified in section 64469.  If the running annual average concentration does not exceed the MCL in table 64444‑A, the water supplier may reduce the sampling frequency to once every year during the quarter that previously yielded the highest analytical result.  Quarterly monitoring shall resume if any reduced frequency sample result exceeds the MCL.  If the running annual average concentration exceeds the MCL in table 64444‑A, the water system shall be deemed to be in violation of section 64444. 
(C) If any sample would cause the running annual average to exceed the MCL, the water system is immediately in violation.  If a system takes more than one sample in a quarter, the average of all the results for that quarter shall be used when calculating the running annual average.  If a system fails to complete four consecutive quarters of monitoring, the running annual average shall be based on an average of the available data.
(6) If any resample, other than those taken in accordance with paragraph (5), of a water sampling site shows that the concentration of any organic chemical exceeds a MCL shown in table 64444‑A, the water supplier shall proceed in accordance with paragraphs (1) and (4), or paragraph (5).
(7) If an organic chemical is detected and the concentration exceeds ten times the MCL, the water supplier shall notify the State Board within 48 hours of the receipt of the results and the contaminated site shall be resampled within 48 hours to confirm the result.  The water supplier shall notify the State Board of the result of the confirmation sample(s) within 24 hours of the receipt of the confirmation result(s).
(A) If the average concentration of the original and confirmation sample(s) is less than or equal to ten times the MCL, the water supplier shall proceed in accordance with paragraph (5).
(B) If the average concentration of the original and confirmation samples exceeds ten times the MCL, use of the contaminated water source shall immediately be discontinued, if directed by the State Board.  Such a water source shall not be returned to service without written approval from the State Board. 
 
§64445.2. Sampling of Treated Water Sources.
(a) Each water supplier utilizing treatment to comply with any MCL for an organic chemical listed in table 64444-A shall collect monthly samples of the treated water at a site prior to the distribution system. If the treated water exceeds the MCL, the water supplier shall resample the treated water to confirm the result and report the result to the State Board within 48 hours of the confirmation.
 
(b) The State Board will consider requiring more frequent monitoring based on an evaluation of (1) the treatment process used, (2) the treatment effectiveness and efficiency, and (3) the concentration of the organic chemical in the water source.

(4) A brief report (agenda, list of attendees, and transcript) of a public 
meeting held by the water system to which customers were invited, and at which both the tabulated results of the customer survey and the engineering report were presented with a request for input from the public.
 
(c) A community water system may apply for a waiver for iron and/or manganese if, in addition to meeting the requirements in Subsection (b), an average of four consecutive quarter results for the source has not exceeded a State Notification Level for iron and/or manganese.  In addition, the system shall include sequestering, as follows:
(1) As one of the alternatives evaluated in the Engineering Report;
(2) In the customer survey as a query:  “Are you willing to pay for iron and/or manganese sequestering treatment?”
 
(d) Unless 50% or more of the billed customers respond to the survey, the community water system shall conduct another survey pursuant to Subsections (b) or (c) within three months from the date of the survey by sending the survey out to either all the customers again, or only the customers that did not respond to the survey.  The water system shall not be eligible for a waiver until it achieves at least a 50% response rate on the survey.
 
(e) If the customer survey indicates that the percentage of billed customers that voted for constituent reduction treatment and the number of billed customers that did not respond to the survey at all exceeds 50% of the total number of billed customers, the community water system shall install treatment, except as provided in Subsection (f), within three years from the date the system completed the customer survey, pursuant to a schedule established by the State Board.
 
(f) For iron and/or manganese MCL waiver applications, if the percentage of survey respondents that voted for constituent reduction treatment plus the percentage of survey respondents that voted for sequestering exceeds the percentage that voted to avoid the cost and maintain the current water quality situation, the community water system shall implement either constituent reduction treatment or sequestering, on the basis of which was associated with the higher percentage result.  If the highest percentage result is for sequestering, the system shall submit a sequestering implementation and assessment plan to the State Board that includes:
(1) A description of the pilot testing or other type of evaluation performed to determine the most effective sequestering agent for use in the system’s water;
(2) The sequestering agent feed rate and the equipment to be used to insure that the rate is maintained for each source;
