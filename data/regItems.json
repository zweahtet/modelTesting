Within 10 days after the period during which the program was required, the system shall submit a letter to the Department demonstrating that it has delivered the public education materials as required and include a list of all the newspapers, radio stations, television stations, facilities and organizations to which the system delivered the materials during the previous year.(1) Except as provided in subsection (b), a community water system shall include the following text in all of the printed materials it distributes through its lead public education program:(A) Introduction. The California Department of Health Services (DHS), the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, and [insert name of water supplier] are concerned about lead in your drinking water. Although most homes have very low levels of lead in their drinking water, some homes in the community have lead levels above the state and federal action level of 15 parts per billion (ppb), or 0.015 milligrams of lead per liter of water (mg/L). Under state and federal law we are required to have a program in place to minimize lead in your drinking water by [insert date when corrosion control will be completed for your system]. This program includes corrosion control treatment, source water treatment, and public education. We are also required to replace the portion of each lead service line that we own if the line contributes lead concentrations of 15 ppb or more after we have completed the comprehensive treatment program. If you have any questions about how we are carrying out the requirements of the lead regulation please give us a call at [insert water system's phone number]. This brochure explains the simple steps you can take to protect you and your family by reducing your exposure to lead in drinking water.(B) Health Effects of Lead. Lead is a common metal found throughout the environment in lead-based paint, air, soil, household dust, food, certain types of pottery porcelain and pewter, and water. Lead can pose a significant risk to your health if too much of it enters your body. Lead builds up in the body over many years and can cause damage to the brain, red blood cells and kidneys. The greatest risk is to young children and pregnant women. Amounts of lead that won't hurt adults can slow down normal mental and physical development of growing bodies. In addition, a child at play often comes into contact with sources of lead contamination -- like dirt and dust -- that rarely affect an adult. It is important to wash children's hands and toys often, and to try to make sure they only put food in their mouths.(C) Lead In Drinking Water1. Lead in drinking water, although rarely the sole cause of lead poisoning, can significantly increase a person's total lead exposure, particularly the exposure of infants who drink baby formulas and concentrated juices that are mixed with water. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency estimates that drinking water can make up 20 percent or more of a person's total exposure to lead.2. Lead is unusual among drinking water contaminants in that it seldom occurs naturally in water supplies like rivers and lakes. Lead enters drinking water primarily as a result of the corrosion, or wearing away, of materials containing lead in the water distribution system and household plumbing. These materials include lead-based solder used to join copper pipe, brass and chrome plated brass faucets, and in some cases, pipes made of lead that connect your house to the water main (service lines). In 1986, Congress banned the use of lead solder containing greater than 0.2% lead, and restricted the lead content of faucets, pipes and other plumbing materials to 8.0%. In California, a similar law prohibiting the use of both lead solder and lead pipe was enacted in 1985.3. When water stands in lead pipes or plumbing systems containing lead for several hours or more, the lead may dissolve into your drinking water. This means the first water drawn from the tap in the morning, or later in the afternoon after returning from work or school, can contain fairly high levels of lead.(D) Steps You Can Take in the Home to Reduce Exposure to Lead in Drinking Water1. Despite our best efforts mentioned earlier to control water corrosivity and remove lead from the water supply, lead levels in some homes or buildings can be high. To find out whether you need to take action in your own home, have your drinking water tested to determine if it contains excessive concentrations of lead. Testing the water is essential because you cannot see, taste, or smell lead in drinking water. Some local laboratories that can provide this service are listed at the end of this booklet. For more information on having your water tested, please call [insert phone number of water system].2. If a water test indicates that the drinking water drawn from a tap in your home contains lead above 15 ppb, then you should take the following precautions:A. Let the water run from the tap before using it for drinking or cooking any time the water in a faucet has gone unused for more than six hours. The longer water resides in your home's plumbing the more lead it may contain. Flushing the tap means running the cold water faucet until the water gets noticeably colder, usually about 15 to 30 seconds. If your house has a lead service line to the water main, you may have to flush the water for a longer time, perhaps one minute, before drinking. Although toilet flushing or showering flushes water through a portion of your home's plumbing system, you still need to flush the water in each faucet before using it for drinking or cooking. Flushing tap water is a simple and inexpensive measure you can take to protect your family's health. It usually uses less than one or two gallons of water and costs less than [insert a cost estimate based on flushing two times a day for 30 days] per month. To conserve water, fill a couple of bottles for drinking water after flushing the tap, and whenever possible use the first flush water to wash the dishes or water the plants. If you live in a high-rise building, letting the water flow before using it may not work to lessen your risk from lead. The plumbing systems have more, and sometimes larger pipes than smaller buildings. Ask your landlord for help in locating the source of the lead and for advice on reducing the lead level.B. Try not to cook with, or drink water from the hot water tap. Hot water can dissolve more lead more quickly than cold water. If you need hot water, draw water from the cold tap and heat it on the stove.C. Remove loose lead solder and debris from the plumbing materials installed in newly constructed homes, or homes in which the plumbing has recently been replaced, by removing the faucet strainers from all taps and running the water from 3 to 5 minutes. Thereafter, periodically remove the strainers and flush out any debris that has accumulated over time.D. If your copper pipes are joined with lead solder that has been installed illegally since it was banned in 1986, notify the plumber who did the work and request that he or she replace the lead solder with leadfree solder. Lead solder looks dull gray, and when scratched with a key looks shiny. In addition, notify the California Department of Health Services and your local environmental health department about the violation.E. Determine whether or not the service line that connects your home or apartment to the water main is made of lead. The best way to determine if your service line is made of lead is by either hiring a licensed plumber to inspect the line or by contacting the plumbing contractor who installed the line. You can identify the plumbing contractor by checking the record of building permits which should be maintained in the files of the [insert name of department that issues building permits]. A licensed plumber can at the same time check to see if your home's plumbing contains lead solder, lead pipes, or pipe fittings that contain lead. The public water system that delivers water to your home should also maintain records of the materials located in the distribution system. If the service line that connects your dwelling to the water main contributes more than 15 ppb to drinking water, after our comprehensive treatment program is in place, we are required to replace the portion of the line we own. If the line is only partially owned by the [insert name of the city, county, or water system that owns the line], we are required to provide the owner of the privately-owned portion of the service line with information on how to replace the privately-owned portion of the service line, and offer to replace that portion of the line at the owner's expense. If we replace only the portion of the line that we own, we also are required to notify you in advance and provide you with information on the steps you can take to minimize exposure to any temporary increase in lead levels that may result from the partial replacement, to take a follow-up sample at our expense from the line within 72 hours after the partial replacement, and to mail or otherwise provide you with the results of that sample within three business days of receiving the results. Acceptable replacement alternatives include copper, stainless steel, and plastic pipes. Partial replacement should avoid the creation of mixed piping systems and include the installation of approved dielectric couplings at all dissimilar metal interfaces.F. Have an electrician check your wiring. If grounding wires from the electrical system are attached to your pipes, corrosion may be greater. Check with a licensed electrician or your local electrical code to determine if your wiring can be grounded elsewhere. DO NOT attempt to change the wiring yourself because improper grounding can cause electrical shock and fire hazards.3. The steps described above will reduce the lead concentrations in your drinking water. However, if a water test indicates that the drinking water coming from your tap contains lead concentrations in excess of 15 ppb after flushing, or after we have completed our actions to minimize lead levels, then you may want to take the following additional measures:A. Purchase or lease a home treatment device. Home treatment devices are limited in that each unit treats only the water that flows from the faucet to which it is connected, and all of the devices require periodic maintenance and replacement. Devices such as reverse osmosis systems or distillers can effectively remove lead from your drinking water. Since these treatments remove dissolved minerals, water treated by these devices will have a greater tendency to leach lead from brass faucets or fittings which the water contacts after treatment. Some activated carbon filters may reduce lead levels at the tap, however all lead reduction claims should be investigated. Be sure to check the actual performance of a specific home treatment device before and after installing the unit. The California Department of Health Services certifies the effectiveness of home treatment devices. Only devices certified by the California Department of Health Services to remove lead should be used for this purpose.B. Purchase bottled water for drinking and cooking.4. You can consult a variety of sources for additional information. Your family doctor or pediatrician can perform a blood test for lead and provide you with information about the health effects of lead. State and local government agencies that can be contacted include:A. [insert the name of city or county department of public utilities] at [insert phone number] can provide you with information about your community's water supply, and a list of local laboratories that have been certified by the California Department of Health Services for testing water quality;B. [insert the name of city or county department that issues building permits] at [insert phone number] can provide you with information about building permit records that should contain the names of plumbing contractors that plumbed your home; andC. California Department of Health Services, Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention Branch at [insert the phone number] or the [insert the name of the city or county health department] at [insert phone number] can provide you with information about the health effects of lead and how you can have your child's blood tested.5. The following is a list of some state approved laboratories in your area that you can call to have your water tested for lead. [Insert names and phone numbers of at least two laboratories].(2) Except as provided in subsection (b), a nontransient-noncommunity water system shall include either the text in paragraph (a)(1) or the following text, in all of the printed materials it distributes through its lead public education program.(A) Introduction. The California Department of Health Services, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and [insert name of water supplier] are concerned about lead in your drinking water. Some drinking water samples taken from this facility have lead levels above the EPA action level of 15 parts per billion (ppb), or 0.015 milligrams of lead per liter of water (mg/L).

When water stands in lead pipes or plumbing systems containing lead for several hours or more, the lead may dissolve into your drinking water. This means the first water drawn from the tap in the morning, or later in the afternoon if the water has not been used all day, can contain fairly high levels of lead.(D) Steps You Can Take. Steps you can take to reduce exposure to lead in drinking water include:1. Let the water run from the tap before using it for drinking or cooking any time the water in a faucet has gone unused for more than six hours. The longer water resides in plumbing the more lead it may contain. Flushing the tap means running the cold water faucet for about 15-30 seconds. Although toilet flushing or showering flushes water through a portion of the plumbing system, you still need to flush the water in each faucet before using it for drinking or cooking. Flushing tap water is a simple and inexpensive measure you can take to protect your health. It usually uses less than one gallon of water.2. Do not cook with, or drink water from the hot water tap. Hot water can dissolve more lead more quickly than cold water. If you need hot water, draw water from the cold tap and then heat it.3. The steps described above will reduce the lead concentrations in your drinking water. However, if you are still concerned, you may wish to use bottled water for drinking and cooking.4. You can consult a variety of sources for additional information. Your family doctor or pediatrician can perform a blood test for lead and provide you with information about the health effects of lead. State and local government agencies that can be contacted include:A. [insert the name or title of facility official if appropriate] at [insert phone number] can provide you with information about your facility's water supply; andB. [insert the name or title of the State Department of Health Services] at [insert phone number] or the [insert the name of the city or county health department] at [insert phone number] can provide you with information about the health effects of lead.(b) Any additional information presented shall be consistent with the information in subsection (a) and be in plain language that can be understood by laypersons. A system may delete information pertaining to lead service lines, on approval by the Department, if the water system does not have any such lines. Building permit record availability and consumer access to these records may be modified, if approved by the Department.(c) The system shall include the following information in all public service announcements submitted under its lead public education program to television and radio stations for broadcasting:(1) Why should everyone want to know the facts about lead and drinking water? Because unhealthy amounts of lead can enter drinking water through the plumbing in your home. That's why I urge you to do what I did. I had my water tested for [insert free or cost per sample]. You can contact the [insert the name of the city or water system] for information on testing and on simple ways to reduce your exposure to lead in drinking water.(2) To have your water tested for lead, or to get more information about this public health concern, please call [insert the phone number of the city or water system].(d) The system shall conduct the lead public education program as follows:(1) In communities where a significant proportion of the population speaks a language other than English, public education materials shall be communicated in the appropriate language(s).(2) Within 60 days after it has a lead action level exceedance, unless it is already conducting a lead public education program, a community water system shall:(A) Insert notices in each customer's water utility bill containing the information in paragraph (a)(1), along with the following alert on the water bill itself in large print: SOME HOMES IN THIS COMMUNITY HAVE ELEVATED LEAD LEVELS IN THEIR DRINKING WATER. LEAD CAN POSE A SIGNIFICANT RISK TO YOUR HEALTH. PLEASE READ THE ENCLOSED NOTICE FOR FURTHER INFORMATION. A community water system with a billing cycle that does not include a billing within 60 days of the exceedance, or that cannot insert information in the bill without making major changes to its billing system, may use a separate mailing as long as it is conducted within 60 days of the exceedance.(B) Submit the information in paragraph (a)(1) to the editorial departments of the major daily and weekly newspapers circulated throughout the community.(C) Deliver pamphlets and/or brochures that contain the public education materials in subparagraphs (a)(1)(B) and (D) to facilities and organizations, including the following:1.

The notice shall be mailed unless an alternate method is approved by the Department, based on the feasibility of insuring that all consumers receive the notice; and(B) Inform the resident(s) that the system will collect a first flush tap water sample within 72 hours after the partial replacement of the service line has been completed if the resident(s) so desire. If the resident(s) accept the offer, the system shall collect the sample and report the results to the resident(s) and the owner within three business days of receiving the results and to the Department.(d) Within 12 months after the lead action level exceedance, and every 12 months thereafter, the system shall submit in writing to the Department the number of lead service lines scheduled to be replaced during the previous year of the system's replacement schedule, along with the following information to the Department:(1) The number and location of each lead service line replaced during the previous year of the system's replacement schedule to demonstrate that it has replaced at least 7 percent of the initial lead service lines within the previous 12 months, or a greater number of lines if required by the Department; or(2) Lead service line sampling results that demonstrate that the lead level from an individual line(s) is less than or equal to 0.015 mg/L, pursuant to section 64689 (Lead Service Line Sampling). The system shall submit the results of the lead service line sampling including the lead levels, location of each lead service line sampled, the sampling method, and the date of sampling. It shall also include the number and location of each lead service line replaced during the previous year. In such cases, the total number of lines replaced and/or that meet the criteria shall equal at least 7 percent of the initial number of lead lines identified or the percentage required by the Department.(e) A system shall replace lead service lines at a faster rate than that required by subsection (b), taking into account the number of lead service lines in the system, if the Department determines either that this is necessary based on elevated blood lead levels in the population served, or that it is feasible to complete the lead service line replacement program in a shorter time without increasing the water rates to the customers.(f) A system may cease replacing lead service lines when it has two consecutive periods without a lead action level exceedance. If the system has a lead action level exceedance during any subsequent period, it shall recommence replacing lead service lines."

  "paragraphText": "(a) The SWSAP PWS shall ensure that prior to augmentation of a surface water reservoir by a SWSAP, the surface water reservoir to be used as an augmented reservoir was in operation as an approved surface water supply pursuant to this Chapter for a period of time sufficient to establish a baseline record of the surface water reservoir's raw water quality (including, but not limited to, the monitoring required pursuant to section 60320.326, Chapter 3), and treated drinking water quality. A surface water reservoir shall have been operating as an approved surface water source for at least five years prior to receiving recycled municipal wastewater from a SWSAP, unless approved otherwise in writing by the State Board, but in no case less than two years.(b) The SWSAP PWS shall ensure that a surface water reservoir used as an augmented reservoir has a minimum theoretical retention time of no less than that which has been approved by the State Board. Monthly, the SWSAP PWS shall calculate and record the theoretical retention time. The theoretical retention time shall be the value (in units of days) resulting from dividing the volume of water in the surface water reservoir at the end of each month, by the total outflow from the surface water reservoir during the corresponding month. The total outflow shall include, but not be limited to, all outflows and withdrawals from the surface water reservoir. An initial approved minimum theoretical retention time may be no less than 180 days.(1) If a month's theoretical retention time is determined to be less than the SWSAP PWS's approved theoretical retention time, the SWSAP PWS shall, by the end of the subsequent month, submit a report to the State Board and Regional Board describing the corrective actions to be taken to ensure future theoretical retention times will be no less than the approved theoretical retention time.(2) A SWSAP PWS may apply to the State Board, for written approval, for a reduced on-going alternative minimum theoretical retention time of less than 180 days, but no less than 60 days. The SWSAP PWS's application shall include all information requested by the State Board for its consideration of a proposed alternative minimum theoretical retention time, including the following:(A) Evidence that the SWSAP PWS and SWSAP WRA have reliably and consistently met the requirements of this Article and Article 5.3, Chapter 3, under varying operating conditions;(B) At the proposed alternative minimum theoretical retention time, the maximum anticipated recycled municipal wastewater flow to the surface water reservoir, the total anticipated outflows from the reservoir, and the total available flows of approved reservoir sources of supply;(C) The maximum percent, by volume, of recycled municipal wastewater that will be delivered to the surface water reservoir during any 24-hour period, in accordance with subsection (c), at the proposed alternative minimum theoretical retention time;(D) A description of total proposed treatment and total log10 reduction for enteric virus, Giardia cysts, and Cryptosporidium oocysts. For proposed alternative minimum theoretical retention times less than 120 days, no less than one log10 reduction of such pathogens beyond that otherwise required pursuant to this Article and Article 5.3, Chapter 3, shall be provided;(E) The ability to adequately respond to potential SWSAP treatment failures in a timely manner, such that there is no interruption of drinking water, meeting all applicable standards, supplied to customers; and(F) A demonstration that the alternative minimum theoretical retention time provides, based on information provided pursuant to subsection (b)(2), an equivalent or better level of protection of public health than otherwise required pursuant to this Article and Article 5.3, Chapter 3. If required by the State Board, the SWSAP PWS's demonstration shall include a review by an independent scientific advisory panel approved by the State Board.(c) Prior to augmentation and whenever requested to do so by the State Board based on information that previous tracer studies or hydrodynamic modeling may not accurately reflect current conditions, the SWSAP PWS shall demonstrate to the State Board, utilizing tracer studies and hydrodynamic modeling, that at all times under all operating conditions, the volume of water withdrawn from the augmented reservoir to be ultimately supplied for human consumption contains no more than:(1) one percent, by volume, of recycled municipal wastewater that was delivered to the surface water reservoir during any 24-hour period, or(2) ten percent, by volume, of recycled municipal wastewater that was delivered to the surface water reservoir during any 24-hour period, with the recycled municipal wastewater delivered by the SWSAP WRA having been subjected to additional treatment producing no less than a 1-log10 reduction of enteric virus, Giardia cysts, and Cryptosporidium oocysts, as noted pursuant to section 60320.308(a)(2). With regard to the additional treatment:(A) The additional treatment need not be a unique type of process from other treatment processes utilized by the SWSAP WRA to meet the requirements of section 60320.308.(B) The SWSAP PWS, in consultation with the SWSAP WRA, shall obtain the additional treatment process information necessary for demonstrating that the requirements of subsection (c)(2) of this section, and section 60320.308(a)(2), will be met.(d) To verify that the requirements of subsection (c) are being met, within the first six months of operation, under hydraulic conditions representative of normal SWSAP operations, the SWSAP PWS shall initiate a tracer study utilizing an added tracer. The results of the tracer study shall be used to validate the hydrodynamic modeling required in subsection (c). Prior to performing the tracer study, the SWSAP PWS shall submit a tracer study protocol for State Board review and written approval. The SWSAP PWS shall perform the verification required by this subsection whenever requested by the State Board.(e) Notwithstanding a change in operation allowed pursuant to the SWSAP PWS's domestic water supply permit, prior to initiating a change in operation, including physical changes to the surface water reservoir, that may impact the hydraulic characterization utilized to determine compliance with the requirements of this section, the SWSAP PWS shall notify the State Board and:(1) demonstrate that the hydraulic characterization used to comply with this section remains valid under the changed operation, or(2) if requested by the State Board, demonstrate compliance pursuant to this section under the new hydraulic conditions.(f) Unless directed otherwise by the State Board, a SWSAP PWS shall utilize an independent scientific advisory panel to meet the requirements of this section pertaining to the hydraulic characterization of the reservoir, including tracer study verifications and hydraulic modeling used to demonstrate compliance with subsection (c). The independent scientific advisory panel shall be approved by the State Board and include, at a minimum, a limnologist with experience modelling the hydraulic characterization of surface water reservoirs, or a limnologist and an individual with experience modelling the hydraulic characterization of surface water reservoirs. The SWSAP PWS shall allow State Board representatives, as guests, to join all independent scientific advisory panel meetings and discussions.(g) Prior to augmentation of a surface water reservoir using a SWSAP, a SWSAP PWS shall submit a plan, for State Board review and approval, describing the actions the SWSAP PWS will take to assess and address potential impacts resulting from the introduction of advanced treated water into the SWSAP PWS's surface water treatment plant and, indirectly, into the drinking water distribution system. At a minimum, the plan shall address:(1) maintaining chemical and microbial stability in the drinking water distribution system as the drinking water quality changes with anticipated increasing fractions of advanced treated water;(2) maintaining treatment effectiveness throughout the surface water treatment plant as the source water quality changes with anticipated increasing fractions of advanced treated water in the reservoir;(3) assessments to be performed prior to and during operation of the SWSAP with respect to paragraphs (1) and (2); and(4) assessment outcomes of which the SWSAP PWS will notify the State Board."

The arsenic standard balances the current understanding of arsenic's possible health effects against the costs of removing arsenic from drinking water. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency continues to research the health effects of low levels of arsenic, which is a mineral known to cause cancer in humans at high concentrations and is linked to other health effects such as skin damage and circulatory problems.”(b) A system that detects nitrate at levels above 5 mg/L (as nitrogen), but below the MCL, shall include the following in its Consumer Confidence Report: “Nitrate in drinking water at levels above 10 mg/L is a health risk for infants of less than six months of age. Such nitrate levels in drinking water can interfere with the capacity of the infant's blood to carry oxygen, resulting in a serious illness; symptoms include shortness of breath and blueness of the skin. Nitrate levels above 10 mg/L may also affect the ability of the blood to carry oxygen in other individuals, such as pregnant women and those with certain specific enzyme deficiencies.

As water travels over the surface of the land or through the ground, it dissolves naturally-occurring minerals and, in some cases, radioactive material, and can pick up substances resulting from the presence of animals or from human activity.”(2) “Contaminants that may be present in source water include:Microbial contaminants, such as viruses and bacteria, that may come from sewage treatment plants, septic systems, agricultural livestock operations, and wildlife.Inorganic contaminants, such as salts and metals, that can be naturally-occurring or result from urban stormwater runoff, industrial or domestic wastewater discharges, oil and gas production, mining, or farming.Pesticides and herbicides, that may come from a variety of sources such as agriculture, urban stormwater runoff, and residential uses.Organic chemical contaminants, including synthetic and volatile organic chemicals, that are by-products of industrial processes and petroleum production, and can also come from gas stations, urban stormwater runoff, agricultural application, and septic systems.Radioactive contaminants, that can be naturally-occurring or be the result of oil and gas production and mining activities.”(3) “In order to ensure that tap water is safe to drink, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) and the State Water Resources Control Board (State Board) prescribe regulations that limit the amount of certain contaminants in water provided by public water systems. U.S. Food and Drug Administration regulations and California law also establish limits for contaminants in bottled water that provide the same protection for public health.”(4) “Drinking water, including bottled water, may reasonably be expected to contain at least small amounts of some contaminants. The presence of contaminants does not necessarily indicate that water poses a health risk. More information about contaminants and potential health effects can be obtained by calling the USEPA's Safe Drinking Water Hotline (1-800-426-4791).”(j) A Consumer Confidence Report shall prominently display the following language: “Some people may be more vulnerable to contaminants in drinking water than the general population. Immuno-compromised persons such as persons with cancer undergoing chemotherapy, persons who have undergone organ transplants, people with HIV/AIDS or other immune system disorders, some elderly, and infants can be particularly at risk from infections. These people should seek advice about drinking water from their health care providers. USEPA/Centers for Disease Control (CDC) guidelines on appropriate means to lessen the risk of infection by Cryptosporidium and other microbial contaminants are available from the Safe Drinking Water Hotline (1-800-426-4791).”(k) A Consumer Confidence Report shall include the telephone number of the owner, operator, or designee of the water system as a source of additional information concerning the report.(l) A Consumer Confidence Report shall contain information in Spanish regarding the importance of the report or contain a telephone number or address where Spanish-speaking residents may contact the system to obtain a translated copy of the report or assistance in Spanish. For each non-English speaking group other than Spanish-speaking that exceeds 1,000 residents or 10% of the residents in a community, the Consumer Confidence Report shall contain information in the appropriate language(s) regarding the importance of the report or contain a telephone number or address where such residents may contact the system to obtain a translated copy of the report or assistance in the appropriate language.(m) A Consumer Confidence Report shall include information (e.g., time and place of regularly scheduled board meetings) about opportunities for public participation in decisions that may affect the quality of the water.(n) A Consumer Confidence Report shall:(1) If a water system is required to comply with a Level 1 or Level 2 assessment requirement that is not due to an E. coli MCL violation, contain the information indicated in Table 64481-A;Table 64481-A.

In addition, the system shall include sequestering, as follows:(1) As one of the alternatives evaluated in the Engineering Report;(2) In the customer survey as a query: “Are you willing to pay for iron and/or manganese sequestering treatment?”(d) Unless 50% or more of the billed customers respond to the survey, the community water system shall conduct another survey pursuant to Subsections (b) or (c) within three months from the date of the survey by sending the survey out to either all the customers again, or only the customers that did not respond to the survey. The water system shall not be eligible for a waiver until it achieves at least a 50% response rate on the survey.(e) If the customer survey indicates that the percentage of billed customers that voted for constituent reduction treatment and the number of billed customers that did not respond to the survey at all exceeds 50% of the total number of billed customers, the community water system shall install treatment, except as provided in Subsection (f), within three years from the date the system completed the customer survey, pursuant to a schedule established by the State Board.(f) For iron and/or manganese MCL waiver applications, if the percentage of survey respondents that voted for constituent reduction treatment plus the percentage of survey respondents that voted for sequestering exceeds the percentage that voted to avoid the cost and maintain the current water quality situation, the community water system shall implement either constituent reduction treatment or sequestering, on the basis of which was associated with the higher percentage result. If the highest percentage result is for sequestering, the system shall submit a sequestering implementation and assessment plan to the State Board that includes:(1) A description of the pilot testing or other type of evaluation performed to determine the most effective sequestering agent for use in the system's water;(2) The sequestering agent feed rate and the equipment to be used to insure that the rate is maintained for each source;(3) An operations plan; and(4) The projected cost of sequestering including capital, operations and maintenance costs.(g) To apply for renewal of a waiver for a subsequent nine years, the system shall request approval from the State Board at least six months prior to the end of the current waiver period. The renewal request shall include all monitoring and treatment operations data for the constituent for which the waiver had been granted and any related customer complaints submitted to the water system. Based on its review of the data and customer complaints, the State Board may require the water system to conduct another customer survey pursuant to this section before making a determination on the waiver renewal."

Health Effects Language  Microbiological ContaminantsContaminantHealth Effects LanguageE. coliE. coli are bacteria whose presence indicates that the water may be contaminated with human or animal wastes. Human pathogens in these wastes can cause short-term effects, such as diarrhea, cramps, nausea, headaches, or other symptoms. They may pose a greater health risk for infants, young children, the elderly, and people with severely-compromised immune systems.Coliform Assessment and/or Corrective Action ViolationsColiforms are bacteria that are naturally present in the environment and are used as an indicator that other, potentially harmful, waterborne pathogens may be present or that a potential pathway exists through which contamination may enter the drinking water distribution system. We found coliforms indicating the need to look for potential problems in water treatment or distribution. When this occurs, we are required to conduct assessment(s) to identify problems and to correct any problems that were found.  For a public notice, the water system shall use the following applicable sentences:  We failed to conduct the required assessment. We failed to correct all identified sanitary defects that were found during the assessment(s). E. coli Assessment and/or Corrective Action ViolationsE. coli are bacteria whose presence indicates that the water may be contaminated with human or animal wastes. Human pathogens in these wastes can cause short-term effects, such as diarrhea, cramps, nausea, headaches, or other symptoms. They may pose a greater health risk for infants, young children, the elderly, and people with severely compromised immune systems. We violated the standard for E. coli, indicating the need to look for potential problems in water treatment or distribution. When this occurs, we are required to conduct a detailed assessment to identify problems and to correct any problems that are found.  For a public notice, the water system shall use the following applicable sentences: We failed to conduct the required assessment.  We failed to correct all identified sanitary defects that were found during the assessment. Seasonal System Treatment Technique ViolationsWhen this violation includes the failure to monitor for total coliforms or E. coli prior to serving water to the public, the mandatory language found at section 64465(a)(11) shall be used.  When the violation includes failure to complete other actions, the appropriate elements found in sections 64465(a)(1) through (10) to describe the violation shall be used. TurbidityTurbidity has no health effects. However, high levels of turbidity can interfere with disinfection and provide a medium for microbial growth. Turbidity may indicate the presence of disease-causing organisms. These organisms include bacteria, viruses, and parasites that can cause symptoms such as nausea, cramps, diarrhea, and associated headaches. .Appendix 64465-B.

CopperCopper is an essential nutrient, but some people who drink water containing copper in excess of the action level over a relatively short amount of time may experience gastrointestinal distress. Some people who drink water containing copper in excess of the action level over many years may suffer liver or kidney damage. People with Wilson's Disease should consult their personal doctor.CyanideSome people who drink water containing cyanide in excess of the MCL over many years may experience nerve damage or thyroid problems.FluorideFor the Consumer Confidence Report: Some people who drink water containing fluoride in excess of the federal MCL of 4 mg/L over many years may get bone disease, including pain and tenderness of the bones. Children who drink water containing fluoride in excess of the state MCL of 2 mg/L may get mottled teeth.  For a Public Notice: This is an alert about your drinking water and a cosmetic dental problem that might affect children under nine years of age. At low levels, fluoride can help prevent cavities, but children drinking water containing more than 2 milligrams per liter (mg/L) of fluoride may develop cosmetic discoloration of their permanent teeth (dental fluorosis). The drinking water provided by your community water system [name] has a fluoride concentration of [insert value] mg/L. Dental fluorosis may result in a brown staining and/or pitting of the permanent teeth. This problem occurs only in developing teeth, before they erupt from the gums. Children under nine should be provided with alternative sources of drinking water or water that has been treated to remove the fluoride to avoid the possibility of staining and pitting of their permanent teeth. You may also want to contact your dentist about proper use by young children of fluoride-containing products. Older children and adults may safely drink the water. Drinking water containing more than 4 mg/L of fluoride can increase your risk of developing bone disease. For more information, please call [water system contact name] of [water system name] at [phone number]. Some home water treatment units are also available to remove fluoride from drinking water. To learn more about available home water treatment units, you may call the State Board's Residential Water Treatment Device Registration Unit at (916) 449-5600.LeadInfants and children who drink water containing lead in excess of the action level may experience delays in their physical or mental development. Children may show slight deficits in attention span and learning abilities. Adults who drink this water over many years may develop kidney problems or high blood pressure.MercurySome people who drink water containing mercury in excess of the MCL over many years may experience mental disturbances, or impaired physical coordination, speech and hearing.NickelSome people who drink water containing nickel in excess of the MCL over many years may experience liver and heart effects.NitrateInfants below the age of six months who drink water containing nitrate in excess of the MCL may quickly become seriously ill and, if untreated, may die because high nitrate levels can interfere with the capacity of the infant's blood to carry oxygen. Symptoms include shortness of breath and blueness of the skin. High nitrate levels may also affect the oxygen-carrying ability of the blood of pregnant women.NitriteInfants below the age of six months who drink water containing nitrite in excess of the MCL may become seriously ill and, if untreated, may die. Symptoms include shortness of breath and blueness of the skin.PerchloratePerchlorate has been shown to interfere with uptake of iodide by the thyroid gland, and to thereby reduce the production of thyroid hormones, leading to adverse effects associated with inadequate hormone levels. Thyroid hormones are needed for normal prenatal growth and development of the fetus, as well as for normal growth and development in the infant and child. In adults, thyroid hormones are needed for normal metabolism and mental function.SeleniumSelenium is an essential nutrient.

(See Title 40, Code of Federal Regulations, section 141.66(d)(2).)(e) If a system analyzes for naturally-occurring potassium-40 beta particle activity from the same or equivalent samples used for the gross beta particle activity analysis, the potassium-40 beta particle activity shall be calculated by multiplying elemental potassium concentrations (in mg/L) by a factor of 0.82 pCi/mg.(f) A system required to monitor under this section may use environmental surveillance data (collected by the nuclear facility to detect any radionuclide contamination) in lieu of monitoring, subject to the State Board's determination that the data is applicable to the system based on a review of the data and the hydrogeology of the area. In the event that there is a release of radioactivity or radioactive contaminants from the nuclear facility, a system using environmental surveillance data shall begin the monitoring in paragraph (b)(1) or (c)(1)(A) through (C), whichever is most applicable.(g) If a sample result is greater than an MCL:(1) Compliance shall be determined as follows:(A) At each sampling site, based on the analytical results for that site. Any confirmation sample result shall be averaged with the initial result.(B) Using all monitoring results collected under this article during the previous 12 months, even if more than the minimum required number of samples was collected.(C) By a running annual average of four consecutive quarters of sampling results where quarterly monitoring is required, or by an annual sample when applicable for tritium and strontium-90. Averages shall be rounded to the same number of significant figures as the MCL for which compliance is being determined.1. If any sample result will cause the annual average at any sample site to exceed the MCL, the system shall be out of compliance immediately after being notified of the result;2. If a system has not analyzed the required number of samples, compliance shall be determined by the average of the samples collected at the site during the most recent 12 months; and3. If a sample result is less than the DLR in 64443, zero shall be used to calculate the annual average.(D) If the system can provide documentation that a sample was subject to sampling or analytical errors, the State Board may invalidate the result based on its review of the documentation, the sampling result, and the historical sampling data.(E) Each system shall ensure that the laboratory analyzing its samples collected for compliance with this article calculates and reports the sample-specific Minimum Detectable Activity at the 95% confidence level (MDA95) along with the sample results. The MDA95 shall not exceed the DLR and is calculated as described in ANSI N42.23 Measurement and Associated Instrumentation Quality Assurance for Radiobioassay Laboratories, Appendix A.7.6. (September 10, 1995).(2) If a sample has a gross beta/photon radioactivity level greater than the MCL:(A) A system shall monitor monthly beginning the month after receiving a result greater than the MCL and continue monthly monitoring until an average of three consecutive monthly sample results does not exceed the MCL;(B) The system shall then monitor quarterly until the average of four consecutive quarterly sample results does not exceed the MCL; and(C) Subsequently, the system shall conduct the monitoring in paragraph (b)(1) or (c)(1)(A) through (C), whichever is most applicable."

A system using surface water shall continue monitoring annually.(2) A system serving more than 3,300 persons which has not detected an SOC on table 64444-A during the initial four quarters of monitoring shall collect a minimum of two quarterly samples for that SOC in one year during the year designated by the State Board of each subsequent compliance period. The year will be designated on the basis of historical monitoring frequency and laboratory capacity.(3) A system serving 3,300 persons or less which has not detected an SOC on table 64444-A during the initial four quarters of monitoring shall collect a minimum of one sample for that SOC during the year designated by the State Board of each subsequent compliance period. The year will be designated on the basis of historical monitoring frequency and laboratory capacity.(c) When organic chemicals are detected pursuant to table 64445.1-A.(1) Prior to proceeding with the requirements of paragraphs (2) through (7), the water supplier may first confirm the analytical result, as follows: Within seven days from the notification of an initial finding from a laboratory reporting the presence of one or more organic chemicals in a water sample, the water supplier shall collect one or two additional sample(s) to confirm the initial finding. Confirmation of the initial finding shall be shown by the presence of the organic chemical in either the first or second additional sample, and the detected level of the contaminant for compliance purposes shall be the average of the initial and confirmation sample(s). The initial finding shall be disregarded if two additional samples do not show the presence of the organic chemical.(2) If one or both of the related organic chemicals heptachlor and heptachlor epoxide are detected, subsequent monitoring shall analyze for both chemicals until there has been no detection of either chemical for one compliance period.(3) A groundwater sampling site at which one or more of the following chemicals has been detected shall be monitored quarterly for vinyl chloride: trichloroethylene, tetrachloroethylene, 1,2-dichloroethane, 1,1,1-trichloroethane, cis-1,2-dichloroethylene, trans-1,2-dichloroethylene, or 1,1-dichloroethylene. If vinyl chloride is not detected in the first quarterly sample, the sampling site shall be monitored once for vinyl chloride during each compliance period.(4) If the detected level of organic chemicals for any sampling site does not exceed any shown in table 64444-A, the water source shall be resampled every three months and the samples analyzed for the detected chemicals. After one year of sampling an approved surface water system or two quarters of sampling a groundwater system, the State Board will consider allowing the water supplier to reduce the sampling to once per year upon request, based on a review of previous sampling data. Systems shall monitor during the quarter(s) which previously yielded the highest analytical results.(5) If the detected level of an organic chemical for any sampling site exceeds that listed in table 64444-A, the water supplier shall report this information to the State Board within 48 hours of receipt of the result. Unless use of the contaminated source is discontinued, the water supplier shall resample the contaminated source and compliance shall be determined as follows:(A) Water systems serving more than 3,300 persons shall sample monthly for six months and shall submit the results to the State Board as specified in section 64469. If the average concentration of the initial finding, confirmation sample(s), and six subsequent monthly samples does not exceed the MCL shown in table 64444-A, the water supplier may reduce the sampling frequency to once every three months. If the running annual average or the average concentration of the initial finding, confirmation sample(s), and six subsequent monthly samples exceeds the MCL shown in table 64444-A, the water system shall be deemed to be in violation of section 64444.(B) Water systems serving 3,300 persons or less shall sample quarterly for a minimum of one year and shall submit the results to the State Board as specified in section 64469. If the running annual average concentration does not exceed the MCL in table 64444-A, the water supplier may reduce the sampling frequency to once every year during the quarter that previously yielded the highest analytical result. Quarterly monitoring shall resume if any reduced frequency sample result exceeds the MCL. If the running annual average concentration exceeds the MCL in table 64444-A, the water system shall be deemed to be in violation of section 64444.(C) If any sample would cause the running annual average to exceed the MCL, the water system is immediately in violation. If a system takes more than one sample in a quarter, the average of all the results for that quarter shall be used when calculating the running annual average. If a system fails to complete four consecutive quarters of monitoring, the running annual average shall be based on an average of the available data.(6) If any resample, other than those taken in accordance with paragraph (5), of a water sampling site shows that the concentration of any organic chemical exceeds a MCL shown in table 64444-A, the water supplier shall proceed in accordance with paragraphs (1) and (4), or paragraph (5).(7) If an organic chemical is detected and the concentration exceeds ten times the MCL, the water supplier shall notify the State Board within 48 hours of the receipt of the results and the contaminated site shall be resampled within 48 hours to confirm the result. The water supplier shall notify the State Board of the result of the confirmation sample(s) within 24 hours of the receipt of the confirmation result(s).(A) If the average concentration of the original and confirmation sample(s) is less than or equal to ten times the MCL, the water supplier shall proceed in accordance with paragraph (5).(B) If the average concentration of the original and confirmation samples exceeds ten times the MCL, use of the contaminated water source shall immediately be discontinued, if directed by the State Board. Such a water source shall not be returned to service without written approval from the State Board."

  "paragraphText": "(a) Each community and nontransient-noncommunity water system shall collect four quarterly samples during the year designated by the State Board of each compliance period beginning with the compliance period starting January 1, 1993, from each water source at a site prior to any treatment and test for all applicable organic chemicals listed in Table 64444-A. The State Board will designate the year based on historical monitoring frequency and laboratory capacity. For surface sources, the samples shall be taken at each water intake. For groundwater sources, the samples shall be taken at each well head. Where multiple intakes or wells draw from the same water supply, the State Board will consider sampling of representative sources as a means of complying with this section. Selection of representative sources shall be based on evidence which includes a hydrogeological survey and sampling results. Wells shall be allowed to flow for a minimum of 15 minutes before sampling to insure that the samples reflect the water quality of the source. In place of water source samples, a supplier may collect samples at sites located at the entry points to the distribution system. The samples shall be representative of each source after treatment. The system shall collect each sample at the same sampling site, unless a change is approved by the State Board.(b) For any organic chemical added to Table 64444-A, the water system shall initiate the quarterly monitoring for that chemical in January of the calendar year after the effective date of the MCL.(c) A water system may request approval from the State Board to composite samples from up to five sampling sites, provided that the number of the sites to be composited is less than the ratio of the MCL to the DLR in Section 64445.1. Approval will be based on a review of three years of historical data, well construction and aquifer information for groundwater, and intake location, similarity of sources, and watershed characteristics for surface water. Compositing shall be done in the laboratory and analyses shall be conducted within 14 days of sample collection.(1) Systems serving more than 3,300 persons shall composite only from sampling sites within a single system. Systems serving 3,300 persons or less may composite among different systems up to the 5-sample limit.(2) If any organic chemical is detected in the composite sample, a follow-up sample shall be analyzed within 14 days from each sampling site included in the composite for the contaminants which were detected. The water supplier shall report the results to the State Board within 14 days of the follow-up sample collection. If available, duplicates of the original sample taken from each sampling site used in the composite may be used instead of resampling.(d) A water system may apply to the State Board for a monitoring waiver for one or more of the organic chemicals on Table 64444-A in accordance with the following:(1) A source may be eligible for a waiver if it can be documented that the chemical has not been previously used, manufactured, transported, stored, or disposed of within the watershed or zone of influence and, therefore, that the source can be designated nonvulnerable.(2) If previous use of the chemical locally is unknown or the chemical is known to have been used previously and the source cannot be designated nonvulnerable pursuant to Paragraph (d)(1), it may still be eligible for a waiver based on a review related to susceptibility to contamination. The application to the State Board for a waiver based on susceptibility shall include the following:(A) Previous monitoring results;(B) user population characteristics;(C) proximity to sources of contamination;(D) surrounding land uses;(E) degree of protection of the water source;(F) environmental persistence and transport of the chemical in water, soil and air;(G) elevated nitrate levels at the water supply source; and(H) historical system operation and maintenance data including previous State Board inspection results.(3) To apply for a monitoring waiver for VOCs, the water system shall have completed the initial four quarters of monitoring pursuant to subsection (a) or three consecutive years of monitoring with no VOCs detected. If granted a waiver for VOC monitoring, a system using groundwater shall collect a minimum of one sample from every sampling site every six years and a system using surface water shall not be required to monitor for the term of the waiver. The term of a VOC waiver shall not exceed three years.(4) To obtain a monitoring waiver for one or more of the SOCs, the water system may apply before doing the initial round of monitoring or shall have completed three consecutive years of annual monitoring with no detection of the SOC(s) listed. If the system is granted a waiver for monitoring for one or more SOC(s), no monitoring for the waived SOC(s) shall be required for the term of the waiver, which shall not exceed three years.(e) For water sources designated by a water supplier as standby sources, the water supplier shall sample each source for any organic chemical added to Table 64444-A once within the three-year period beginning in January of the calendar year after the effective date of the MCL.(f) Water quality data collected prior to January 1, 1988, for VOCs, or January 1, 1990, for SOCs, and/or data collected in a manner inconsistent with this section shall not be used in the determination of compliance with the monitoring requirements for organic chemicals.(g) MTBE data (i.e., a single sample) collected in a manner consistent with this section after January 1, 1998 in which no MTBE is detected, along with a designation of nonvulnerability pursuant to subsection (d), may be used to satisfy the initial monitoring requirements in subsection (a). If the requirements are satisfied in this way by a water system, the system shall begin annual monitoring pursuant to Section 64445.1(b)(1).(h) Water quality data collected in compliance with the monitoring requirements of this section by a wholesaler agency providing water to a public water system shall be acceptable for use by that system for compliance with the monitoring requirements of this section.(i) Results obtained from groundwater monitoring performed for an organic chemical in accordance with this section and not more than two calendar years prior to the effective date of a regulation establishing the MCL for that organic chemical may be substituted to partially satisfy the initial monitoring requirements required by this section for that organic chemical. Requests to substitute groundwater monitoring results shall be made in accordance with the following:1. Requests shall be made in writing by the water system to the State Board; and2.

  "paragraphText": "(a) If a routine sample is total coliform-positive, a public water system shall collect a repeat sample set as described in paragraph (1) within 24 hours of being notified of the positive result. The repeat samples shall all be collected within the same 24-hour time period. A single service connection system may submit a request to the State Board to allow the collection of the repeat sample set over a three-day period.(1) A repeat sample set shall be at least three samples for each total coliform-positive sample.(2) If the system is unable to collect the samples within the 24-hour time period specified in subsection (a) or deliver the samples to the laboratory within 24 hours after collection because of circumstances beyond its control, the system shall notify the State Board within 24 hours. The State Board will then determine how much time the system will have to collect the repeat samples.(b) Unless the condition for using alternative sampling locations or dual purpose sampling locations in Table 64424-A or B, respectively, is met, when collecting the repeat sample set, a public water system shall collect at least one repeat sample from the sampling tap where the original total coliform-positive sample was taken. Other repeat samples shall be collected within five service connections upstream or downstream of the original site. At least one sample shall be from upstream and one from downstream unless there is no upstream and/or downstream service connection. If a total coliform-positive sample is at the end of the distribution system, or one service connection away from the end of the distribution system, the system shall still take all required repeat samples. The system may submit a request to the State Board to use an alternative sampling location in lieu of the requirement to collect at least one repeat sample upstream or downstream of the original sampling site. Except as provided in Table 64424-B, a system required to conduct triggered source water monitoring under 40 CFR 141.402(a), which is incorporated by reference under Section 64430, shall take groundwater (not GWUDI) source sample(s) in addition to repeat samples required under this section. If monitoring pursuant to Table 64424-B and in violation of the E. coli MCL, the system shall comply with the additional Ground Water Rule requirements in Table 64424-C.Table 64424-A  Alternative Sampling LocationsType of Water SystemSampling Requirement Public water systemThe system may propose repeat monitoring locations to the State Board that the system believes to be representative of a pathway for contamination of the distribution system. The system may elect to specify either alternative fixed locations or criteria for selecting repeat sampling sites on a situational basis in a standard operating procedure (SOP) in its bacteriological sample siting plan. The system shall design its SOP to focus the repeat samples at locations that best verify and determine the extent of potential contamination of the distribution system area based on specific situations.Table 64424-B  Dual Purpose Sampling LocationsType of Water SystemSampling RequirementPublic water system using only a single groundwater (not GWUDI) well, serving 1,000 or fewer persons, and required to conduct triggered source water monitoring under 40 CFR 141.402(a), which is incorporated by reference under Section 64430The system may propose repeat sampling locations to the State Board that differentiate potential source water and distribution system contamination (e.g., by sampling at entry points to the distribution system). The system may submit a request to the State Board to take one of its repeat samples at the monitoring location required for triggered source water monitoring (dual purpose sampling) under 40 CFR 141.402(a), which is incorporated by reference under Section 64430, if the system demonstrates to the State Board that the bacteriological sample siting plan remains representative of water quality in the distribution system. If approved by the State Board, the system may use that sample result to meet the monitoring requirements in both 40 CFR 141.402(a), which is incorporated by reference under Section 64430, and this section.Table 64424-C  Additional Ground Water Rule RequirementsResults of Dual Purpose Sampling that Constitutes an E. coli MCL  ViolationPublic Water System Action Required A repeat sample taken at the monitoring location required for triggered source water monitoring is E. coli-positiveThe system shall comply with 40 CFR 141.402(a)(3), which is incorporated by reference under Section 64430. If the system takes more than one repeat sample at the monitoring location required for triggered source water monitoring, the system may reduce the number of additional source water samples required under 40 CFR 141.402(a)(3), which is incorporated by reference under Section 64430, by the number of repeat samples taken at that location that were not E. coli-positive.  A system takes more than one repeat sample at the monitoring location required for triggered source water monitoring and more than one repeat sample is E. coli-positiveThe system shall comply with 40 CFR 141.403(a)(1), which is incorporated by reference under Section 64430. All repeat samples taken at the monitoring location required for triggered source water monitoring are E. coli-negative and a repeat sample taken at a monitoring location other than the one required for triggered source water monitoring is E. coli-positiveThe system is not required to comply with 40 CFR 141.402(a)(3), which is incorporated by reference under Section 64430.(c) If one or more samples in the repeat sample set is total coliform-positive, a public water system shall collect and have analyzed an additional set of repeat samples as specified in subsections (a) and (b). The system shall repeat this process until either no total coliforms are detected in one complete repeat sample set or the system determines that a coliform treatment technique trigger specified in Section 64426.7 has been exceeded as a result of a repeat sample being total coliform-positive and notifies the State Board by the end of the day on which this is determined. If a treatment technique trigger identified in Section 64426.7 is exceeded as a result of a routine sample being total coliform-positive, the system is required to conduct only one round of repeat monitoring for each total coliform-positive routine sample.(d) A public water system in violation of the repeat sample monitoring requirements of this section shall notify the State Board within 10 days after it learns of the violation and notify the public pursuant to Sections 64463, 64463.7, and 64465.(e) A public water system in violation of the reporting requirement in subsection (d) to notify the State Board shall notify the public pursuant to Sections 64463, 64463.7, and 64465."

  "paragraphText": "(a) A public water system shall collect routine bacteriological water samples as follows:(1) The minimum number of samples for community water systems shall be based on the known population served or the total number of service connections, whichever results in the greater number of samples, as shown in Table 64423-A;(2) The minimum number of samples for nontransient-noncommunity water systems shall be based on the known population served as shown in Table 64423-A during those months when the system is operating;(3) The minimum number of samples for transient-noncommunity water systems using only groundwater (not GWUDI) and serving 1000 or fewer persons a month shall be one in each calendar quarter during which the system provides water to the public;(4) The minimum number of samples for transient-noncommunity water systems using groundwater (not GWUDI) and serving more than 1000 persons during any month shall be based on the known population served as shown in Table 64423-A. For any quarter the system serves 1000 or fewer persons in each month and uses only groundwater (not GWUDI), and if the criteria in subsections (c)(2)(A) and (B) are met, the system may submit a request to the State Board to monitor in accordance with paragraph (3). The request shall include:(A) Historical data that demonstrates the system has served 1000 or fewer persons in each month of the calendar quarter for which the request is being made; and(B) A revised bacteriological sample siting plan with an updated sampling schedule;(5) The minimum number of samples for transient-noncommunity water systems using approved surface water shall be based on the population served as shown in Table 64423-A. A system using groundwater under the direct influence of surface water shall begin monitoring at this frequency by the end of the sixth month after the State Board has designated the source to be approved surface water;(6) The minimum number of samples for seasonal systems, and in lieu of paragraphs (2) through (5), shall be based on the population served as shown in Table 64423-A during those months when the system is operating;(7) Samples shall be collected at regular time intervals throughout the month, except that a system using only groundwater (not GWUDI) which serves 4,900 persons or fewer may collect all required samples on a single day if they are taken from different sites;(8) At least the minimum number of samples shall be taken even if the system has had an E. coli MCL violation or has exceeded the coliform treatment technique triggers in Section 64426.7; and(9) More than the minimum number of samples may be taken provided the samples are included in the bacteriological sample siting plan developed pursuant to Section 64422.(b) In addition to the minimum sampling requirements, all public water systems using approved surface water which do not practice filtration in compliance with Sections 64650 through 64666, shall collect a minimum of one sample before or at the first service connection each day during which the turbidity level of the source water exceeds 1 NTU. The sample shall be collected within 24 hours of the first exceedance and shall be analyzed for total coliforms. If the system is unable to collect and/or analyze the sample within the 24-hour time period because of extenuating circumstances beyond its control, the system shall notify the State Board within the 24-hour time period, submit a request to the State Board for an extension, and comply with an alternative sample collection schedule specified by the State Board. Sample results shall be included in determining if the coliform treatment technique trigger in Section 64426.7 has been exceeded.(c) A transient-noncommunity water system monitoring pursuant to subsection (a)(3):(1) Shall, in the month following the occurrence of any of the following events, increase monitoring to one sample each month:(A) The system triggers a Level 2 assessment or two Level 1 assessments in a rolling 12-month period;(B) The system has an E. coli MCL violation;(C) The system has a coliform treatment technique violation; or(D) The system has two bacteriological monitoring violations or one bacteriological monitoring violation and one Level 1 assessment in a rolling 12-month period. For purposes of this subparagraph, failure to conduct bacteriological monitoring under Section 64423, 64423.1, 64424, or 64425 is a bacteriological monitoring violation;(2) If monitoring pursuant to paragraph (1) and if all the following criteria are met, may submit a request to the State Board to return to routine monitoring pursuant to subsection (a)(3):(A) Within the last 12 consecutive months, the system shall have a completed sanitary survey, site visit, or voluntary Level 2 assessment by the State Board and be determined by the State Board to be free of sanitary defects and have a protected water source; and(B) Immediately prior to the request, the system shall have a clean compliance history for a minimum of 12 consecutive months; and(3) Shall, in the month following one or more total coliform-positive samples (with or without a Level 1 treatment technique trigger exceedance), collect at least three routine samples. The system may either collect samples at regular time intervals throughout the month or may collect all required routine samples on a single day if samples are taken from different sites. If the system stops supplying water during the month following the total coliform-positive(s), at least three routine samples shall be collected during the first month the system resumes operation.(d) A public water system in violation of the routine sample monitoring requirements of this section shall notify the State Board within 10 days after it learns of the violation and notify the public pursuant to Sections 64463, 64463.7, and 64465.(e) A public water system in violation of the reporting requirement in subsection (d) to notify the State Board shall notify the public pursuant to Sections 64463, 64463.7, and 64465.Table 64423-AMinimum Number of Routine Total Coliform SamplesMonthly  Population Served1Service ConnectionsMinimum  Number of  Samples  Per Month25 to 100015 to 400 11,001 to 2,500401 to 890 22,501 to 3,300891 to 1,180 33,301 to 4,1001,181 to 1,460 44,101 to 4,9001,461 to 1,750 54,901 to 5,8001,751 to 2,100 65,801 to 6,7002,101 to 2,400 76,701 to 7,6002,401 to 2,700 87,601 to 8,5002,701 to 3,000 98,501 to 12,9003,001 to 4,600 1012,901 to 17,2004,601 to 6,100 1517,201 to 21,5006,101 to 7,700 2021,501 to 25,0007,701 to 8,900 2525,001 to 33,0008,901 to 11,800 3033,001 to 41,00011,801 to 14,600 4041,001 to 50,00014,601 to 17,900 5050,001 to 59,00017,901 to 21,100 6059,001 to 70,00021,101 to 25,000 7070,001 to 83,00025,001 to 29,600 8083,001 to 96,00029,601 to 34,300 9096,001 to 130,00034,301 to 46,400100130,001 to 220,00046,401 to 78,600120220,001 to 320,00078,601 to 114,300150320,001 to 450,000114,301 to 160,700180450,001 to 600,000160,701 to 214,300210600,001 to 780,000214,301 to 278,600240780,001 to 970,000278,601 to 346,400270970,001 to 1,230,000346,401 to 439,3003001,230,001 to 1,520,000439,301 to 542,9003301,520,001 to 1,850,000542,901 to 660,7003601,850,001 to 2,270,000660,701 to 810,7003902,270,001 to 3,020,000810,701 to 1,078,6004203,020,001 to 3,960,0001,078,601 to 1,414,3004503,960,001 or more1,414,301 or more4801  For a transient-noncommunity water system, monthly population served shall be based on the average number of persons served per day in a month."

  "paragraphText": "(a) All public water systems shall monitor to determine compliance with the nitrate and nitrite MCLs in table 64431-A, pursuant to subsections (d) through (f) and section 64432.1. All community and nontransient-noncommunity water systems shall monitor to determine compliance with the perchlorate MCL, pursuant to subsections (d), (e), and (l), and section 64432.3. All community and nontransient-noncommunity water systems shall also monitor to determine compliance with the other MCLs in table 64431-A, pursuant to subsections (b) through (n), and, for asbestos, section 64432.2. Monitoring shall be conducted in the year designated by the State Board of each compliance period beginning with the compliance period starting January 1, 1993.(b) Unless directed otherwise by the State Board, each community and nontransient-noncommunity water system shall initiate monitoring for an inorganic chemical within six months following the effective date of the regulation establishing the MCL for the chemical and the addition of the chemical to table 64431-A.If otherwise performed in accordance with this section, groundwater monitoring for an inorganic chemical performed no more than two years prior to the effective date of the regulation establishing the MCL may be used to satisfy the requirement for initiating monitoring within six months following such effective date.(c) Unless more frequent monitoring is required pursuant to this Chapter, the frequency of monitoring for the inorganic chemicals listed in table 64431-A, except for asbestos, nitrate/nitrite, and perchlorate, shall be as follows:(1) Each compliance period, all community and nontransient-noncommunity systems using groundwater shall monitor once during the year designated by the State Board. The State Board will designate the year based on historical monitoring frequency and laboratory capacity. All community and nontransient-noncommunity systems using approved surface water shall monitor annually. All systems monitoring at distribution entry points which have combined surface and groundwater sources shall monitor annually.(2) Quarterly samples shall be collected and analyzed for any chemical if analyses of such samples indicate a continuous or persistent trend toward higher levels of that chemical, based on an evaluation of previous data.(d) For the purposes of sections 64432, 64432.1, 64432.2, and 64432.3, detection shall be defined by the detection limits for purposes of reporting (DLRs) in table 64432-A.Table 64432-ADetection Limits for Purposes of Reporting (DLRs) for Regulated Inorganic ChemicalsChemicalDetection Limit for  Purposes of Reporting  (DLR) (mg/L)Aluminum0.05 Antimony0.006 Arsenic0.002 Asbestos0.2  MFL>10μm* Barium0.1 Beryllium0.001 Cadmium0.001 Chromium0.01 Cyanide0.1 Fluoride0.1 Mercury0.001 Nickel0.01 Nitrate (as nitrogen)0.4 Nitrite (as nitrogen)0.4 Perchlorate0.002  0.001  (Effective January 1, 2024) Selenium0.005 Thallium0.001*  MFL=million fibers per liter; DLR for fibers exceeding 10 μm in length.(e) Samples shall be collected from each water source or a supplier may collect a minimum of one sample at every entry point to the distribution system which is representative of each source after treatment. The system shall collect each sample at the same sampling site, unless a change is approved by the State Board.(f) A water system may request approval from the State Board to composite samples from up to five sampling sites, provided that the number of sites to be composited is less than the ratio of the MCL to the DLR. Approval will be based on a review of three years of historical data, well construction and aquifer information for groundwater, and intake location, similarity of sources, and watershed characteristics for surface water. Compositing shall be done in the laboratory.(1) Systems serving more than 3,300 persons shall composite only from sampling sites within a single system. Systems serving 3,300 persons or less may composite among different systems up to the 5-sample limit.(2) If any inorganic chemical is detected in the composite sample at a level equal to or greater than one fifth of the MCL, a follow-up sample shall be analyzed within 14 days from each sampling site included in the composite for the contaminants which exceeded the one-fifth-MCL level. If available, duplicates of the original sample taken from each sampling site used in the composite may be used instead of resampling; the analytical results shall be reported within 14 days. The water supplier may collect up to two additional samples each from one or more of the sources to confirm the result(s).(3) Compliance for each site shall be determined on the basis of the individual follow-up samples, or on the average of the follow-up and confirmation sample(s) if the supplier collects confirmation sample(s) for each detection.(g) If the level of any inorganic chemical, except for nitrate, nitrite, nitrate plus nitrite, or perchlorate, exceeds the MCL, the water supplier shall do one of the following:(1) Inform the State Board within 48 hours and monitor quarterly beginning in the next quarter after the exceedance occurred; or(2) Inform the State Board within seven days from the receipt of the analysis and, as confirmation, collect one additional sample within 14 days from receipt of the analysis. If the average of the two samples collected exceeds the MCL, this information shall be reported to the State Board within 48 hours and the water supplier shall monitor quarterly beginning in the next quarter after the exceedance occurred.(h) If the concentration of an inorganic chemical exceeds ten times the MCL, within 48 hours of receipt of the result the water supplier shall notify the State Board and resample as confirmation. The water supplier shall notify the State Board of the result(s) of the confirmation sample(s) within 24 hours of receipt of the confirmation result(s).(1) If the average concentration of the original and confirmation sample(s) is less than or equal to ten times the MCL, the water supplier shall monitor quarterly beginning in the quarter following the quarter in which the exceedance occurred.(2) If the average concentration of the original and confirmation sample(s) exceeds ten times the MCL, the water supplier shall, if directed by the State Board;(A) Immediately discontinue use of the contaminated water source; and(B) Not return the source to service without written approval from the State Board.(i) Compliance with the MCLs shall be determined by a running annual average; if any one sample would cause the annual average to exceed the MCL, the system is immediately in violation. If a system takes more than one sample in a quarter, the average of all the results for that quarter shall be used when calculating the running annual average. If a system fails to complete four consecutive quarters of monitoring, the running annual average shall be based on an average of the available data.(j) If a system using groundwater has collected a minimum of two quarterly samples or a system using approved surface water has collected a minimum of four quarterly samples and the sample results have been below the MCL, the system may apply to the State Board for a reduction in monitoring frequency.(k) Water quality data collected prior to January 1, 1990, and/or data collected in a manner inconsistent with this section shall not be used in the determination of compliance with the monitoring requirements for inorganic chemicals.(l) Water quality data collected in compliance with the monitoring requirements of this section by a wholesaler providing water to a public water system shall be acceptable for use by that system for compliance with the monitoring requirements of this section.(m) A water system may apply to the State Board for a waiver from the monitoring frequencies specified in subsection (c)(1), if the system has conducted at least three rounds of monitoring (three periods for groundwater sources or three years for approved surface water sources) and all previous analytical results are less than the MCL. The water system shall specify the basis for its request. If granted a waiver, a system shall collect a minimum of one sample per source while the waiver is in effect and the term of the waiver shall not exceed one compliance cycle (i.e., nine years).(n) A water system may be eligible for a waiver from the monitoring frequencies for cyanide specified in subsection (c)(1) without any prior monitoring if it is able to document that it is not vulnerable to cyanide contamination pursuant to the requirements in section 64445(d)(1) or (d)(2).(o) Transient-noncommunity water systems shall monitor for the inorganic chemicals in table 64431-A as follows:(1) All sources shall be monitored at least once for fluoride; and(2) Surface water sources for parks and other facilities with an average daily population use of more than 1,000 people and/or which are determined to be subject to potential contamination based on a sanitary survey shall be monitored at the same frequency as community water systems."

If the average of the samples collected under section 64534.2(a) exceeds the MCL, the system shall increase monitoring to once per quarter per treatment plant. Compliance with the MCL shall then be determined by the average of the sample that triggered the quarterly monitoring and the following three quarters of monitoring, unless the result of fewer than four quarters of monitoring will cause the running annual average to exceed the MCL, in which case the system is in violation immediately. After monitoring quarterly for four consecutive quarters (including the quarter that triggered the quarterly monitoring), and until such time as monitoring returns to routine monitoring pursuant to section 64534.2(a)(3), compliance shall be determined pursuant to paragraph (1);(3) If the running annual arithmetic average of quarterly averages covering any consecutive four-quarter period exceeds the MCL, the system is in violation of the MCL and shall notify the public pursuant to sections 64463, 64463.4, and 64465, including language in appendix 64465-G, in addition to reporting to the State Board pursuant to sections 64537 through 64537.6; and(4) If a public water system fails to complete four consecutive quarters of monitoring, compliance with the MCL for the last four-quarter compliance period shall be based on an average of the available data.(c) Compliance for bromate shall be based on a running annual arithmetic average, computed quarterly, of monthly samples (or, for months in which the system takes more than one sample, the average of all samples taken during the month) collected by the system as prescribed by section 64534.2(c). If the average of samples covering any consecutive four-quarter period exceeds the MCL, the system is in violation of the MCL and shall notify the public pursuant to sections 64463, 64463.4, and 64465, including language in appendix 64465-G, in addition to reporting to the State Board pursuant to sections 64537 through 64537.6. If a public water system fails to complete 12 consecutive months of monitoring, compliance with the MCL for the last four-quarter compliance period shall be based on an average of the available data.(d) Compliance for chlorite shall be based on the results of samples collected by the system pursuant to section 64534.2(b).(1) If any daily sample taken at the entrance to the distribution system exceeds the chlorite MCL and one (or more) of the three samples taken in the distribution system pursuant to section 64534.2(b)(1) exceeds the chlorite MCL, the system is in violation of the MCL and shall take immediate corrective action to reduce the concentration of chlorite to a level below the MCL. The system shall notify the State Board within 48 hours of the determination and notify the public pursuant to the procedures for acute health risks in sections 64463, 64463.1, and 64465, including language in appendix 64465-G, in addition to reporting to the State Board pursuant to sections 64537 through 64537.6.

If the average of the individual sample and its confirmation does not exceed the MCL, the system shall inform the State Board of the results within seven days from receipt of the original analysis. Failure to take a confirmation sample pursuant to section 64534.2(b)(4) is also an MCL violation and the system shall notify and report as described in paragraph (1); and(3) If any two consecutive daily samples taken at the entrance to the distribution system exceed the chlorite MCL and all distribution system samples taken pursuant to section 64534.2(b)(1) are less than or equal to the chlorite MCL, the system is in violation of the MCL and shall take corrective action to reduce the concentration of chlorite to a level below the MCL at the point of sampling. The system shall notify the public pursuant to the procedures for nonacute health risks in sections 64463, 64463.4, and 64465, including the language in appendix 64465-G, in addition to reporting to the State Board pursuant to sections 64537 through 64537.6. Failure to monitor at the entrance to the distribution system the day following an exceedance of the chlorite MCL at the entrance to the distribution system is also an MCL violation and the system shall notify and report as described in this paragraph.(e) TTHM and HAA5 MCL compliance, as monitored pursuant to section 64534.2(d), shall be determined as follows:(1) For systems monitoring quarterly, each locational running annual average (LRAA), computed quarterly, shall not exceed the MCLs specified in section 64533;(2) For systems monitoring annually or less frequently, each sample collected shall not exceed the MCLs specified in section 64533. If no sample exceeds the MCL, the sample result for each monitoring location shall be considered the LRAA for the monitoring location. If any sample exceeds the MCL, systems shall increase monitoring pursuant to section 64534.2(d)(5). Compliance with the MCL shall then be determined by the average of the sample that triggered the quarterly monitoring and the following three quarters of monitoring, unless the result of fewer than four quarters of monitoring will cause the LRAA to exceed the MCL, in which case the system is in violation immediately. After monitoring quarterly for four consecutive quarters (including the quarter that triggered the quarterly monitoring), and until such time as monitoring returns to routine monitoring pursuant to section 64534.2(d)(5), compliance shall be determined pursuant to paragraph (1);(3) If a system fails to complete four consecutive quarters of monitoring, compliance with the MCL for the last four-quarter compliance period shall be based on an average of the available data. If more than one sample per quarter is taken at a monitoring location, all the samples taken in the quarter at that monitoring location shall be averaged to determine a quarterly average to be used in the LRAA calculation; and(4) If the LRAA exceeds the MCL, calculated based on four consecutive quarters of monitoring (or the LRAA calculated based on fewer than four quarters of data if the MCL would be exceeded regardless of the monitoring results of subsequent quarters), the system is in violation of the MCL and shall notify the public pursuant to sections 64463, 64463.4, and 64465, including the language in appendix 64465-G, in addition to reporting to the State Board pursuant to sections 64537 through 64537.6."

If the State Board approves the Step 2 removal requirements pursuant to subsection (d), and the system conducted monthly TOC monitoring beginning one year prior to the compliance date specified in section 64530, the Step 2 removal requirements will be retroactive to the compliance date for the purposes of determining compliance.(d) Applications made to the State Board by systems using enhanced coagulation for approval of Step 2 removal requirements under subsection (c) shall include, as a minimum, results of bench-scale or pilot-scale testing conducted under paragraph (1) of this subsection that were used to determine the alternate enhanced coagulation level.(1) Alternate enhanced coagulation level is defined as coagulation at a coagulant dose and pH as determined by the method described in paragraphs (1) through (4) such that an incremental addition of 10 mg/L of alum (or equivalent addition of iron coagulant) results in a TOC removal of <0.3 mg/L. The percent removal of TOC at this point on the “TOC removal versus coagulant dose” curve is then defined as the Step 2 removal requirement for the system. Once approved by the State Board, this Step 2 removal requirement supersedes the minimum TOC removal required by section 64536.2(b). This requirement shall be effective until such time as the State Board approves a new value based on the results of a new bench-scale or pilot-scale test.(2) Bench-scale or pilot-scale testing of enhanced coagulation shall be conducted by using representative water samples and adding 10 mg/L increments of alum (or equivalent addition of iron coagulant) until the pH is reduced to a level less than or equal to the enhanced coagulation Step 2 target pH shown in table 64536.2-B.Table 64536.2-B Enhanced Coagulation Step 2 Target pHAlkalinity  mg/L as CaCO3Target pH 0-605.5>60-1206.3>120-2407.0>2407.5(3) For waters with alkalinities of less than 60 mg/L for which the addition of small amounts of alum (or equivalent addition of iron coagulant) drives the pH below 5.5 before significant TOC removal occurs, the system shall add necessary chemicals to maintain the pH between 5.3 and 5.7 in samples until the TOC removal of 0.3 mg/L per 10 mg/L alum added (or equivalent addition of iron coagulant) is reached.(4) If the TOC removal is consistently less than 0.3 mg/L of TOC per 10 mg/L of incremental alum dose at all dosages of alum (or equivalent addition of iron coagulant), the system is eligible to apply for a waiver of enhanced coagulation requirements. The application shall include, as a minimum, the results of bench-scale or pilot-scale testing conducted under paragraph (1) of this subsection."

If collected, these samples count toward the weekly coliform sampling requirement; and(3) For turbidity at a minimum frequency of once every four hours. A supplier may substitute continuous turbidity monitoring for grab sample monitoring if, at regular intervals, it validates the accuracy of the continuous measurement using a protocol approved by the State Board.(c) The approved surface water quality monitored pursuant to subsection (b) shall meet the following criteria:(1) The fecal coliform concentration shall be equal to or less than 20/100 mL, or the total coliform concentration shall be equal to or less than 100/100 mL, in representative samples of the approved surface water in at least 90 percent of the measurements made for the six previous months that the system served unfiltered approved surface water to the public on an ongoing basis. If a system measures both fecal and total coliforms, the fecal coliform criterion, not the total coliform criterion, in this paragraph shall be met; and(2) The turbidity level shall not exceed 5 NTU in representative samples of the approved surface water unless:(A) The State Board determines that any such event was caused by circumstances that were unusual and unpredictable; and(B) As a result of any such event, there have not been more than two events in the past 12 months the system served unfiltered approved surface water to the public, or more than five events in the past 120 months the system served unfiltered approved surface water to the public, in which the turbidity level exceeded 5 NTU. An “event” is one day or a series of consecutive days during which at least one turbidity measurement each day exceeds 5 NTU.(d) Water quality information collected pursuant to subsection (a) shall be reported to the State Board in conformance with the requirements of 40 CFR section 141.75(a)(1) (54 Fed.

The adequacy of the program to limit potential contamination by Giardia lamblia cysts, viruses, and Cryptosporidium oocysts shall be determined by: the comprehensiveness of the watershed review; the effectiveness of the supplier's program to monitor and control detrimental activities occurring in the watershed; and the extent to which the water system has maximized land ownership and/or controlled land use within the watershed. At a minimum, the watershed control program shall:(1) Characterize the watershed hydrology and land ownership;(2) Identify watershed characteristics and activities which may have an adverse effect on source water quality;(3) Monitor the occurrence of activities which may have an adverse effect on source water quality. The supplier shall demonstrate through ownership and/or written agreements with landowners within the that it can control all human activities which may have an adverse impact on the microbiological quality of the water. The supplier shall submit an annual report to the State Board that identifies any special concerns about the watershed and how they are being handled; describes activities in the watershed that affect water quality; and projects what adverse activities are expected to occur in the future and how the public water system expects to address them; and(4) Monitor the presence of Giardia lamblia cysts in the approved surface water whenever agricultural grazing, water oriented recreation, or point source domestic wastewater discharges occur on the watershed. At a minimum the monitoring shall measure the Giardia lamblia cyst concentration monthly at a point immediately prior to the first or only point of disinfectant application. The monitoring results shall be included in an annual report to the State Board. This monitoring requirement may be waived after one year for a supplier serving fewer than 500 persons when the monitoring results indicate a mean Giardia lamblia cyst concentration of 1 cyst per 100 liters or less.(f) The water system shall be subject to an annual on-site inspection to assess the watershed control program and disinfection treatment process. Either the State Board or a party approved by the State Board shall conduct the on-site inspection. The inspection shall be conducted by competent individuals who have a sound understanding of public health principles and waterborne diseases, such as sanitary engineers, civil engineers, environmental health specialists, or technicians who have experience and knowledge about the operation and maintenance of a public water system. A report of the on-site inspection summarizing all findings shall be prepared every calendar year and submitted to the State Board, if not conducted by the State Board, by December 31 of that year. The on-site inspection shall be comprehensive to enable the State Board to determine whether the watershed control program and disinfection treatment process are adequately designed and maintained. The on-site inspection shall include:(1) A review of the effectiveness of the watershed control program;(2) A review of the physical condition of the source intake and how well it is protected;(3) A review of the supplier's equipment maintenance program to ensure there is low probability for failure of the disinfection process;(4) An inspection of the disinfection equipment for physical deterioration;(5) A review of operating procedures;(6) A review of data records to ensure that all required tests are being conducted and recorded and disinfection is effectively practiced; and(7) Identification of any improvements which are needed in the equipment, system maintenance and operation, or data collection.(g) The water system shall not have been identified as a source of a waterborne microbial disease outbreak, or if it has been so identified, the system shall have been modified sufficiently to prevent another such occurrence, as determined by the State Board.(h) The water system shall comply with the E. coli maximum contaminant level (MCL) specified in 22 CCR section 64426.1 at least 11 of the 12 previous months that the system served water to the public on an ongoing basis, unless the State Board determines that failure to meet this requirement was not caused by the unfiltered approved surface water.(i) The water system shall comply with the requirements for total trihalomethanes, haloacetic acids (five), bromate, chlorite, chlorine, chloramines, and chlorine dioxide specified in 22 CCR, division 4, chapter 15.5, commencing with section 64530.(j) The supplier shall provide to the State Board an annual report, by December 31st of each year, which summarizes its compliance with all the watershed control program requirements.(k) The water system shall meet the following special disinfection requirements:(1) The water system shall not fail to provide disinfection treatment sufficient to ensure at least a 99.9 percent inactivation of Giardia lamblia cysts and a 99.99 percent inactivation of viruses for more than one day in any month the water system served unfiltered approved surface water. The means used to demonstrate the required percent inactivation with disinfection shall be in conformance with the requirements of 40 CFR sections 141.72(a)(1), and 141.74(b)(3) and (b)(4) (54 Fed. Reg. 27486 (June 29, 1989)), which are incorporated by reference. Disinfection information collected pursuant to this subsection shall be reported to the State Board in conformance with the requirements of 40 CFR section 141.75(a)(2) (54 Fed. Reg. 27486 (June 29, 1989)), which is incorporated by reference. The necessity to install filtration as a result of a failure to meet the requirements in subsection (c) will not apply if:(A) Either the supplier meets the requirements of subsection (c) at least 11 of the 12 previous months that the system served unfiltered approved surface water to the public on an ongoing basis; or(B) The system fails to meet the requirements of subsection (c) during 2 of the 12 previous months that the system served unfiltered approved surface water to the public; and(C) The State Board determines that failure to meet the requirements in subsection (c) for at least one of these months was caused by circumstances that were unusual and unpredictable.(2) The disinfection system shall have either:(A) Redundant components, including an auxiliary power supply with automatic start-up and alarm to ensure that disinfectant application is maintained continuously while water is being delivered to the distribution system; or(B) Automatic shut-off of delivery of water to the distribution system whenever there is less than 0.2 mg/L of residual disinfectant concentration in the water.(3) The water system shall meet the requirements of section 64654(b)(1) at all times the system serves unfiltered approved surface water to the public unless the State Board determines that any such failure was caused by circumstances that were unusual and unpredictable; and(4) The water system shall meet the requirements of section 64654(b)(2) on an ongoing basis unless the State Board determines that failure to meet these requirements was not caused by a deficiency in treatment of the unfiltered approved surface water.(l) Whenever the monitoring of the quality of the approved surface water indicates the turbidity exceeds 5.0 NTU, or the fecal coliform level exceeds 20/100 mL or the total coliform concentration exceeds 100/100 mL in 10 percent or more of the samples collected in the previous six months during which the system served unfiltered approved surface water to the public on an ongoing basis, the source shall be removed from service. The source may be returned to service when monitoring subsequent to removing the source from service demonstrates that the turbidity is less than or equal to 5.0 NTU and the fecal coliform level is less than or equal to 20/100 mL or the total coliform level is less than or equal to 100/100 mL for two consecutive days, and Giardia lamblia monitoring results indicate 1 cyst per 100 liters or less. If a system measures both fecal and total coliforms, the fecal coliform criterion, not the total coliform criterion, in this subsection shall be met."

  "paragraphText": "A SWSAP WRA shall ensure the continuous treatment, with full advanced treatment meeting the criteria in this section, of the entire recycled municipal wastewater stream prior to its delivery to an augmented reservoir. Full advanced treatment is the treatment of an oxidized wastewater, as defined in section 60301.650, using a reverse osmosis and an oxidation treatment process that, at a minimum, meets the criteria of this section.(a) A SWSAP WRA shall select for use a reverse osmosis membrane such that:(1) each membrane element used in the SWSAP has achieved a minimum rejection of sodium chloride of no less than 99.0 percent (99.0%) and an average (nominal) rejection of sodium chloride of no less than 99.2 percent (99.2%), as demonstrated through Method A of ASTM International's method D4194-03 (2014), hereby incorporated by reference, using the following substitute test conditions:(A) a recovery of permeate of no less than 15 percent (15%);(B) sodium chloride rejection is based on three or more successive measurements, after flushing and following at least 30 minutes of operation having demonstrated that rejection has stabilized;(C) an influent pH no less than 6.5 and no greater than 8.0;(D) an influent sodium chloride concentration of no greater than 2,000 mg/L, to be verified prior to the start of testing; and(E) an applied pressure no greater than 225 pounds per square inch (psi); and(2) during the first twenty weeks of full-scale operation the membrane produces a permeate with no more than five percent (5%) of the sample results having TOC concentrations greater than 0.25 mg/L (or an alternative surrogate parameter and corresponding limit approved by the State Board), as verified through monitoring no less frequent than weekly.(b) For the reverse osmosis treatment process, a SWSAP WRA shall propose, for State Board review and written approval, on-going performance monitoring (e.g., conductivity, TOC, etc.) that indicates when the integrity of the process has been compromised. The proposal shall include at least one form of continuous monitoring, as well as the associated surrogate and/or operational parameter limits and alarm settings that indicate when the integrity has been compromised.(c) To demonstrate a sufficient oxidation treatment process has been designed for implementation, the SWSAP WRA shall conduct testing demonstrating that an oxidation treatment process will provide no less than 0.5-log10 (69 percent) reduction of 1,4-dioxane.(1) A SWSAP WRA shall submit a testing protocol, as well as the subsequent results, to the State Board for review and written approval. The testing shall include challenge or spiking tests, using 1,4-dioxane, to demonstrate the proposed oxidation treatment process will achieve the minimum 0.5-log10 reduction under the proposed oxidation treatment process's normal full-scale operating conditions.(2) A SWSAP WRA shall establish, and submit to the State Board for review and written approval, surrogate and/or operational parameters that indicate whether the minimum 0.5-log10 1,4-dioxane reduction design criterion is being met. At least one surrogate or operational parameter shall be capable of being monitored continuously, recorded, and have associated alarms that indicate when the process is not operating as designed.(d) During full-scale operation of the oxidation treatment process designed pursuant to subsection (c), a SWSAP WRA shall continuously monitor the surrogate and/or operational parameters established pursuant to subsection (c)(2). A SWSAP WRA shall implement, in full-scale operation, the oxidation treatment process as designed pursuant to subsection (c).(e) Within sixty (60) days after completing the first 12-months of full-scale operational monitoring pursuant to subsection (d), a SWSAP WRA shall submit a report to the State Board and Regional Board that includes:(1) results of surrogate and/or operational parameter monitoring conducted pursuant to subsection (d);(2) a description of the efficacy of the surrogate and/or operational parameters to reflect the reduction criterion for 1,4-dioxane; and(3) a description of actions taken, or yet to be taken, if any of the following occurred during the first 12 months of operation:(A) the 1,4-dioxane reduction did not meet the associated design criteria in subsection (c), as indicated by the on-going continuous operational surrogate and/or operational parameter monitoring;(B) if 1,4-dioxane was present, the continuous surrogate and/or operational parameter monitoring failed to correspond to the reduction criterion for 1,4-dioxane; and(C) any failure, interruption, or other incident that may have resulted in insufficient oxidation treatment having occurred.(f) Within sixty (60) days after completing the initial 12 months of operation of the reverse osmosis process (or alternative process approved pursuant to 60320.330), a SWSAP WRA shall submit a report to the State Board and Regional Board describing the effectiveness of the treatment, process failures that occurred, and actions taken in the event the on-going monitoring, conducted pursuant to subsection (b), indicated that process integrity was compromised.(g) Each quarter, a SWSAP WRA shall calculate what percent of results of the quarter's monitoring, conducted pursuant to subsections (b) and (d), did not meet the surrogate and/or operational parameter limits established to assure proper on-going performance of the reverse osmosis and oxidation processes. If the percent is greater than ten, within forty-five (45) days after the end of the quarter a SWSAP WRA shall:(1) submit a report to the State Board and Regional Board that identifies the reason(s) for the failure, if known, and describes the corrective actions planned or taken to reduce the percent to ten percent (10%) or less; and(2) consult with the State Board and Regional Board and, if directed by the State Board or Regional Board, comply with an alternative monitoring plan approved by the State Board and Regional Board.(h) Each month a SWSAP WRA shall collect samples representative of the effluent of the advanced treatment process under normal operating conditions and have the samples analyzed for contaminants having MCLs and notification levels (NLs). After 12 consecutive months with no results exceeding an MCL or NL, a SWSAP WRA may apply to the State Board and Regional Board for a reduced monitoring frequency. The reduced monitoring frequency for a contaminant with an MCL shall be no less than quarterly. With State Board and Regional Board approval, monitoring conducted pursuant to this subsection may be used in lieu of the monitoring (for the same contaminants) required pursuant to sections 60320.312 and 60320.320. If an MCL or NL is exceeded, the SWSAP WRA shall take the follow-up actions for MCL and NL exceedances required pursuant to section 60320.312 and section 60320.320(b), respectively."
